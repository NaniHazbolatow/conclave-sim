# Utility-Based Group Formation for Conclave Simulation

## Current Utility Function Analysis

The existing `compute_utility()` function provides a sophisticated multi-factor scoring system:

- **Connection Strength**: Network distance between cardinals (closer = higher utility)
- **Ideological Proximity**: Political alignment similarity (closer = higher utility) 
- **Influenceability**: Inverse centrality (less influential = higher utility to target)
- **Interaction Effects**: Network connections Ã— ideological alignment

## Implementation Approach

### Option A: Direct Utility-Based Grouping (Recommended)

    Parameters:
    - network_graph: NetworkX graph with cardinal network data
    - cardinal_list: List of cardinal names/IDs 
    - group_sizes: List of desired group sizes [3, 4, 3, ...]
    - utility_threshold: 0-1, minimum utility for grouping preference (higher = more selective)
    - beta: Utility function weights (connection, ideology, influenceability, interaction)

### Option B: Simplified Distance-Based Grouping

```python
def generate_simple_utility_groups(network_graph, cardinal_list, group_sizes, homophily=0.7):
    """
    Simplified approach using just connection strength + ideological proximity.
    
    Parameters:
    - homophily: 0-1, where 1 = only group with highest utility, 0 = random
    """
    
    # Use simplified utility: just connection + ideology  
    beta = (1.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.5)  # (connection, ideology, no influenceability, some interaction)
    
    return generate_utility_groups(network_graph, cardinal_list, group_sizes, 
                                   utility_threshold=homophily, beta=beta)
```

## Advantages of Utility-Based Approach

âœ… **Uses existing sophisticated model** - leverages the multi-factor utility computation
âœ… **Incorporates all key factors** - network distance, ideology, influence, interactions  
âœ… **Tunable via threshold** - utility_threshold acts like homophily parameter
âœ… **Flexible weighting** - can adjust beta weights for different scenarios
âœ… **Realistic groupings** - based on actual cardinal relationships and characteristics

## Potential Missing Information

ðŸ¤” **Nationality/Regional factors** - not explicitly in utility function (could be added)
ðŸ¤” **Age cohort effects** - generational similarity not captured
ðŸ¤” **Institutional experience** - Vatican dicastery relationships only partly captured

## Recommendation

**Start with Option A** (Direct Utility-Based Grouping) because:
1. It uses the sophisticated utility model you already have
2. The utility_threshold parameter gives you the same control as homophily (0-1)
3. You can easily tune the beta weights to emphasize different factors
4. It's a natural extension of your existing network analysis

The utility scores effectively capture the most important grouping factors:
- **Social connections** (who knows whom)
- **Political alignment** (ideological similarity) 
- **Strategic considerations** (influence levels)
- **Interaction effects** (connected AND ideologically similar)

**Missing regional/age factors** could be added later if needed, but the current utility model captures the most crucial relationships for realistic conclave groupings.
