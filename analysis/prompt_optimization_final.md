# Enhanced Prompt System - Final Implementation

## ðŸŽ¯ Prompt Optimization Complete

Based on the gaps analysis, I've successfully implemented all the recommended improvements to eliminate repetitive discussions and enhance realism.

## âœ… Implemented Improvements

### 1. **Memory-Retrieval Cue**
- **Feature**: Recent Speech Snippets auto-inserted
- **Implementation**: `{recent_speech_snippets}` parameter
- **Purpose**: Prevents verbatim repetition by showing agents their recent phrasing patterns
- **Example**: `"Round 1: 'Esteemed colleagues, as we begin this crucial process...'"`

### 2. **Reflection Hook**  
- **Feature**: Silent Reflection requirement
- **Implementation**: "SILENT REFLECTION (do not output): In one sentence, remind yourself what you must do differently from last round."
- **Purpose**: Forces agents to self-critique and avoid stagnant arguments
- **Token limit**: <10 tokens, ignored in output

### 3. **Varied Formal Greetings**
- **Feature**: Speech Requirements updated
- **Implementation**: "Begin with a varied formal greeting unlike your last two"
- **Purpose**: Eliminates formulaic "Esteemed brothers..." openings
- **Result**: More natural speech variation

### 4. **Explicit Call-to-Action**
- **Feature**: Required voting requests
- **Implementation**: "End with a one-sentence call for a specific voting action"
- **Purpose**: Makes speeches end with clear, concrete requests rather than vague conclusions
- **Examples**: "Vote for Cardinal X," "Join me in supporting..."

### 5. **Richness Over Padding**
- **Feature**: Structured output requirement
- **Implementation**: "Produce 1-2 tightly argued paragraphs" instead of "strategic, convincing contribution"
- **Purpose**: Encourages substantive arguments rather than fluffy padding
- **Result**: More focused, impactful speeches

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### New Agent Methods:
```python
def get_recent_speech_snippets(self) -> str:
    """Extract last 2-3 speech snippets (~30 words each) to avoid repetition"""
```

### Enhanced Parameters:
- `recent_speech_snippets`: Memory cue for avoiding repetition
- All existing short-term memory features preserved
- Background integration maintained
- Round awareness continued

### Prompt Structure:
```yaml
PERSONAL BACKGROUND & ROLE:
YOUR CURRENT STANCE:
VOTING CONTEXT:
RECENT SPEECH SNIPPETS (auto-inserted):
DISCUSSION CONTEXT:
TACTICAL FRAMEWORK:
  **Strategic Objectives:**
  **Speech Requirements:**
    - Begin with varied formal greeting unlike your last two
    - End with one-sentence call for specific voting action
SILENT REFLECTION (do not output):
```

## ðŸ“Š Demonstrated Results

### Before Enhancement:
- Repetitive "Esteemed brothers..." openings
- Vague, non-committal endings
- Stagnant arguments across rounds
- Padding to meet word counts

### After Enhancement:
- âœ… Varied greetings: "Esteemed colleagues," "Distinguished Brothers"
- âœ… Clear calls-to-action: "vote for Cardinal Acerbi," "support his candidacy"  
- âœ… Memory awareness: Agents reference their previous speech patterns
- âœ… Tighter arguments: More focused, substantive content
- âœ… Self-reflection: Agents avoid repeating previous approaches

## ðŸŽ‰ Impact Assessment

### Eliminated Issues:
1. **Repetition and lack of continuity** â†’ Memory-retrieval cues
2. **Stagnant arguments** â†’ Silent reflection hook  
3. **Formulaic openings** â†’ Varied greeting requirements
4. **Weak conclusions** â†’ Explicit call-to-action mandate
5. **Fluffy padding** â†’ Tightly argued paragraph structure

### Enhanced Capabilities:
- **Temporal awareness**: Agents know what they said before
- **Strategic evolution**: Forced self-critique drives argument development  
- **Natural variation**: Speech patterns avoid mechanical repetition
- **Decisive action**: Every speech ends with concrete voting requests
- **Substantive content**: Focus on tight argumentation over word count

## ðŸš€ Production Status

The enhanced prompt system is **fully operational** and addresses all identified gaps:

- âœ… **No memory-retrieval cue** â†’ Fixed with recent speech snippets
- âœ… **Missing reflection hook** â†’ Fixed with silent reflection requirement  
- âœ… **Formulaic openings** â†’ Fixed with varied greeting mandate
- âœ… **No explicit call-to-action** â†’ Fixed with voting action requirement
- âœ… **Word-count padding** â†’ Fixed with tightly argued paragraph structure

The conclave simulation now produces sophisticated, non-repetitive discussions with clear strategic progression and authentic cardinal discourse.
