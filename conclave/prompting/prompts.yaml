  SYSTEM · Group-Summary Bot
  Input  : transcript of round {round_id} for a specific discussion group.

  **Task:**
  Analyze the following discussion transcript and extract:
  1. Three most salient key points or arguments made (each <= 25 words).
  2. The names of the (up to) three primary speakers involved in these key points.
  3. The overall tone of this specific group discussion.

  Transcript:
  {group_transcript_text}

  **Output Format:**
  You MUST return ONLY a valid JSON object structured according to the tool definition.
  The JSON object should contain the fields: "key_points" (an array of strings), "speakers" (an array of strings), and "overall_tone" (a string: "harmonious", "mixed", or "tense").
  Example structure: {{"key_points": ["point1", "point2", "point3"], "speakers": ["speaker1", "speaker2", "speaker3"], "overall_tone": "mixed"}}

  Persona snapshot:
  {persona_internal}
  Stance digest:
  {previous_stance}

  Round summary:
  {group_analysis_summary_text}

  **Internal Thought Process (Do NOT output this part directly):**
  1.  **Arguments & Alignment**: Which arguments in the recent discussion were most persuasive or concerning? How do they align with your own persona and core values?
  2.  **Strategic Assessment**: How has this discussion affected your assessment of the leading candidates? Is there a path to victory for your preferred candidate?
  3.  **Long-Term Strategy**: Does this discussion change your long-term strategy? Are you more or less convinced of your current course of action?

  **Task:**
  Based on your internal thought process, formulate a **Reflection Digest**. This digest must be a concise internal monologue (up to 75 words) summarizing your current strategic thinking.

  **Output Format:**
  You MUST return ONLY a valid JSON object containing your reflection digest.
  The JSON object should look EXACTLY like this, with your digest replacing the placeholder:
  {{"reflection_digest": "<Your concise reflection digest here, <= 75 words>"}}

  Reflection digest:

  **Your Decision-Making Process:**
  1.  **Primary Pick**: Who is your preferred candidate? Your choice should be deeply rooted in your persona. What specific aspects of your persona drive this decision?
  2.  **Conviction**: This is a sacred duty. How strong is your conviction? Are you willing to hold your vote for this candidate, even if they are not the front-runner? What are the long-term consequences of your vote?
  3.  **Strategic Outlook**: Is there a path to victory for your chosen candidate? What steps can you take in the next round of discussions to build a coalition around them?
  4.  **Abstention**: If no candidate aligns with your core values, you can choose to abstain from voting. An abstention is a valid choice and signals your dissatisfaction with the current options.

  **Stance Digest (1-2 sentences, plain language):** Based on the above, summarize your voting intention and the core reason for it. If you are abstaining, state that clearly.
