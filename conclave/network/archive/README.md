# Network Archive

This folder contains network-related files that are not used in the main simulation system but may be useful for research, analysis, or future development.

## Archived Files

### `network.py`
- **Purpose**: Standalone network analysis and visualization script
- **Usage**: Creates network visualizations and computes utility scores
- **Dependencies**: `network_utils.py`
- **Outputs**: `cardinal_network.png`
- **Status**: Not used in production simulation, but useful for network research

### `network_utils.py`
- **Purpose**: Utility functions for network analysis
- **Functions**: `add_networks`, `load_node_attributes`, `pope_candidate`
- **Used by**: `network.py` only
- **Status**: Support library for network analysis script

### `utility_grouping_overlapping.py`
- **Purpose**: Unknown (empty file)
- **Status**: Empty file, possibly a placeholder for future development

### `cardinal_network.png`
- **Purpose**: Network visualization output
- **Generated by**: `network.py`
- **Status**: Example output file

## Production Files (Not Archived)

The following files remain in the main network directory as they are actively used by the simulation:

- `grouping.py` - Core grouping algorithms used by the simulation
- `network_manager.py` - Main interface for network-based group assignment

## Note

If you need to use any of these archived files, they can be moved back to the main network directory. However, be aware that `network.py` may need its import path updated since it currently imports from `network_utils` with a relative import.
