0,Santos Abril y Castelló,"Santos Abril y Castelló is a retired Spanish Vatican diplomat who has had a long and distinguished career in both the Holy See’s diplomatic service and the Roman Curia. Born on September 21, 1935, in Alfambra, Spain, he was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Teruel and Albarracín on March 19, 1960. After his ordination, Abril y Castelló pursued further studies in Rome, where he earned doctorates in social sciences and canon law at the University of St. Thomas Aquinas and the Pontifical Gregorian University, respectively. Following this, he attended the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, which trains Vatican diplomats. Abril y Castelló began his diplomatic career in the Vatican in 1967, working in various posts, including assignments in Pakistan and Turkey. In 1985, he was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Bolivia. From 1989 to 1996, he served as pro-nuncio to Cameroon, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea. This was followed by being sent to Yugoslavia in 1996 as apostolic nuncio, and later as nuncio to Argentina from 2000 to 2003. Between 2003 and 2011, he also held the position of nuncio to Slovenia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Macedonia. After his time in the diplomatic service, Abril y Castelló took on several key roles within the Roman Curia. In 2011, he was appointed vice-camerlengo of the Apostolic Chamber, playing a crucial supporting role to the Cardinal Camerlengo, particularly during any period of sede vacante between two popes. Later that same year, he was named Archpriest of the Basilica of St. Mary Major. Pope Benedict XVI elevated him to the rank of cardinal in 2012. In his capacity as a cardinal, Abril y Castelló served in various Vatican congregations, including the Congregation for Bishops and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. He also participated in the 2013 papal conclave, which elected Pope Francis, and served as president of the Commission of Cardinals overseeing the Institute for the Works of Religion (Vatican Bank) beginning in 2014. Abril y Castelló became well known for his role in teaching Spanish to Pope John Paul II. He prepared the Pope for his first international trip to Mexico in 1979, helping him to communicate spontaneously in Spanish and read prepared texts fluently. During his career, Santos Abril y Castelló has also been involved in addressing serious issues within Institute of the Incarnate Word (IVE). As Comisario Pontificio (Pontifical Commissioner) of the IVE, he had to confront numerous problems within the order. In 2023, he sent a letter to IVE members expressing concerns and laying out strict measures after years of interventions by the Holy See. These interventions included restrictions placed on the institute’s founder, who faced accusations of sexual and power abuses. Abril y Castelló noted in his letter that despite 30 years of efforts by the Holy See and four Pontifical Commissioners, little had changed in the institute. He reprimanded the order for an unauthorized meeting with its restricted founder, calling the incident “a truly serious matter.”","• Theology/Ideology: Abril y Castelló emphasizes a diplomatic approach to theological issues, aiming for unity within the Church while addressing complex social challenges.

1,Angelo Acerbi,"Cardinal Angelo Acerbi, a retired distinguished Vatican diplomat kidnapped by Colombian guerillas in 1980, is the oldest man ever to be made cardinal after Pope Francis elevated him to the College in December 2024 at the age of 99. Born on September 23, 1925, in Sesta Godano, Italy, he was ordained a priest on March 27, 1948, for the Diocese of La Spezia. He pursued higher education, earning degrees in canon law and theology before entering the diplomatic service of the Holy See in 1954 after completing his studies at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. His diplomatic career began with assignments in various nunciatures, including Colombia, Brazil, Japan, and France. On June 22, 1974, Pope Paul VI appointed Acerbi as Archbishop of Zella and Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to New Zealand and Apostolic Delegate to the Pacific Ocean. Pope Paul VI himself consecrated Acerbi a bishop on June 30, 1974. One of the most notable events in Acerbi’s career occurred during his tenure as Apostolic Nuncio to Colombia. On February 27, 1980, he was taken hostage along with other diplomats when communist guerrillas from the 19th of April Movement attacked the embassy of the Dominican Republic in Bogota. Acerbi spent six weeks in captivity, during which he was allowed to celebrate Mass daily for the hostages. He was among the last to be released in Havana on April 28, 1980. Throughout his career, Acerbi served as Apostolic Nuncio to several countries, including Hungary (1990-1997), Moldova (1994-1997), and the Netherlands (1997-2001). His appointment as nuncio to Hungary in 1990 was particularly significant, as he was the first to hold this position after the fall of communism in the country. After retiring from active diplomatic service in 2001, Acerbi continued to serve the Church in various capacities. He was appointed to several curial positions, including membership in the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and the Congregation for Bishops. From 2001 to 2015, he served as the Prelate of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. Acerbi’s elevation to cardinal in 2024 came as a surprise, given his advanced age. At 99, he became the oldest man ever to be named a cardinal. Due to his age, he will not be eligible to vote in a future conclave, but his appointment is seen as a recognition of his long service to the Church, and in recognition for all the diplomats of the Holy See. Throughout his career, Acerbi has been known for his diplomatic skills and dedication to the Church. His experiences, particularly during the hostage crisis in Colombia, have made him a respected figure in Vatican diplomacy.","• Theology/Ideology: Acerbi's long career in the Church reflects a commitment to diplomacy and ecumenism, emphasizing the importance of dialogue across diverse cultures and ideologies.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his diplomatic acumen, Acerbi has a reputation for patience and resilience, particularly highlighted by his experience during his six-week hostage crisis in Colombia.  
• Power Base: His extensive experience as an Apostolic Nuncio in various countries has established him as a respected figure within both the Vatican and international Catholic circles.  
• Core Motivation: Acerbi is driven by a deep dedication to serving the Church and promoting peace and understanding through his diplomatic efforts.","Cardinal Angelo Acerbi has dedicated his extensive career to the Church, demonstrating a strong commitment to diplomacy and ecumenism through meaningful dialogue across diverse cultures and ideologies.

2,José Fuerte Advincula,"Cardinal José Fuerte Advincula, the current Archbishop of Manila, is a staunch proponent of synodality and shares a similar vision for the Church as Pope Francis. Born on March 30, 1952, in Dumalag, Capiz, Philippines, he pursued his early education at St. Pius X Seminary in Roxas City, where he completed both his high school and philosophy studies. He later studied theology at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila. On April 14, 1976, Advincula was ordained as a priest for the Archdiocese of Capiz. Early in his career, he served as spiritual director, professor, and dean of studies at St. Pius X Seminary. In addition to his theological training, Advincula earned degrees in guidance and counseling from De La Salle University and canon law from both the University of Santo Tomas and the Angelicum in Rome. Throughout his priesthood, Cardinal Advincula worked at various seminaries in Vigan, Nueva Segovia, and Jaro, before returning to Capiz, where he was appointed rector of St. Pius X Seminary in 1995. He took on multiple roles within the archdiocese, including Defender of the Bond, Promoter of Justice, and Judicial Vicar. In 1999, he was appointed pastor of Santo Tomas de Villanueva Parish in Dao. On July 25, 2001, Advincula was appointed Bishop of San Carlos, and ten years later, on November 9, 2011, he was elevated to Archbishop of Capiz. His rise in the Catholic hierarchy continued when Pope Francis made him a cardinal on November 28, 2020. Shortly after, on March 25, 2021, he was appointed Archbishop of Manila. Cardinal Advincula has been an active participant in the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines, serving on the Commission for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Commission for Indigenous Peoples. During his tenure as Archbishop of Capiz, he focused on reaching out to underserved communities, establishing mission stations and schools in remote areas, and emphasizing the importance of bringing the Church closer to people living on the peripheries. Cardinal Advincula has been a strong proponent of synodality. During the launch of the Synod on Synodality in 2021, he emphasized the importance of creating opportunities for dialogue and listening at the local level. He stated, “In God’s family, you have a voice, and your voice counts,” encouraging the involvement of as many people as possible in the synodal process. The Cardinal expressed his commitment to listening to various groups, including women, children, the elderly, business sector members, government officials, the LGBTQ+ community, and ordinary workers. He emphasized, “We want to listen to you. We want to journey with you. We want to discern God’s will with you.” Regarding divorce, following the passage of the Absolute Divorce Law in the Philippines in May 2024, Cardinal Advincula viewed the bill as a challenge for the Catholic Church in its ministry on the importance of the Sacrament of Matrimony. He cautioned that the law is “not a magic pill that can solve marital problems.” Cardinal Advincula’s approach seems to emphasize dialogue, inclusivity, and listening to diverse voices within the Church community, aligning with Pope Francis’s vision for a more synodal Church. Due to COVID-19 travel restrictions, Cardinal Advincula received his red hat as a cardinal in the Philippines in June 2021, rather than in Rome. He was formally installed as Archbishop of Manila on June 24, 2021, a significant event that coincided with the 450th anniversary of the founding of the city of Manila. In 2024, Cardinal Advincula made headlines when he suspended a priest who was involved in a public scuffle.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Advincula is a strong advocate for synodality, emphasizing dialogue and inclusivity in line with Pope Francis's vision for the Church.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his approachable demeanor and commitment to listening to diverse voices, fostering collaboration within the Church community.

3,Américo Manuel Aguiar Alves,"Cardinal Américo Manuel Aguiar Alves, the Bishop of Setúbal, Portugal, is a progressive prelate and one of the Church’s youngest cardinals whose reputed communication skills jettisoned him into leading the 2023 World Youth Day in Lisbon. Born on December 12, 1973, in Leça do Balio, Portugal, Aguiar Alves studied theology at the Catholic University of Portugal and later earned a master’s degree in communication sciences from Lisbon. Prior to his ecclesiastical career, Aguiar briefly engaged in politics, serving as a town councilor under the Socialist Party. Bishop Aguiar has reportedly never hidden his political background and brief career, and in fact says he is proud of it. He was ordained priest in 2001 and steadily rose through the ranks, taking on roles such as vicar general, parish priest, and communication director for the Diocese of Porto. He became the auxiliary bishop of Lisbon in 2019, gaining recognition for his leadership and organizational skills. Aguiar Alves’ rise has been marked by rapid advancements within the Church. As president of the World Youth Day 2023 Foundation, he oversaw the largest post-pandemic event for young Catholics, which drew over 1.5 million attendees. His skills in communication and crisis management earned him praise, particularly for resolving issues such as the high costs of the WYD stage and controversial media reports during the event, some of which, however, were of his own making. During the preparations for WYD 2023, he made headlines by saying in an interview: “We don’t want to convert young people to Christ or to the Catholic Church.” The remark drew widespread criticism as it seemed to downplay the Church’s evangelizing mission. He later clarified his statement, explaining that WYD was not meant to be an aggressive proselytizing event but rather an opportunity for participants to experience Christ through fellowship and reflection. Aguiar Alves was indirectly criticised for other aspects of WYD’s organisation, such as the storage of consecrated hosts in plastic containers, and logistics issues involving accommodation and transportation for pilgrims. The controversies did not hinder his chances of promotion under the leadership of Pope Francis, however, who appointed Aguiar Bishop of Setúbal, a city 30 miles from Lisbon, and made him a cardinal in late 2023. He became one of the youngest cardinals and an unusual choice as normally the Patriarch of Lisbon is elevated to the College but as of December 2024, he remains without a red hat. Aguiar Alves close relationship with the Pope has led to speculation about future responsibilities in the global Church. In December 2024, Cardinal Aguiar revealed he had shed none of his socialist sympathies by attending the closing session of a congress held by the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP), a significant political force and one of the country’s oldest political parties. He justified his presence by saying the party is “close to the people,” adding that he could “just as easily tomorrow” be at a congress of Portugal’s right wing parties. “What is important is that all parties use a language that addresses the real problems of every Portuguese person,” he said.  Cardinal Aguiar Alves’ rapid rise, organization of a major Church event, and his focus on youth and communications represent significant achievements. However, his comments on conversion, his unapologetically close ties to socialists and communists, and some aspects of WYD organization have also generated controversy among the faithful.","• Theology/Ideology: Aguiar Alves embodies a progressive theology that prioritizes youth engagement and social issues over traditional evangelization methods.  
• Personality/Negotiation: His exceptional communication skills and crisis management abilities have positioned him as a capable negotiator, adept at navigating controversies and fostering dialogue.  
• Power Base: His rapid ascent within the Church, coupled with a strong connection to Pope Francis and a reputation for effective event organization, has solidified his influence among younger clergy and laity.  
• Core Motivation: Aguiar Alves is driven by a desire to connect the Church with contemporary societal issues, advocating for inclusivity while maintaining a focus on communal experiences of faith.","Cardinal Américo Manuel Aguiar Alves is recognized for his progressive theological approach, emphasizing youth engagement and social issues in the context of contemporary faith.

4,Carlos Aguiar Retes,"Cardinal Carlos Aguiar Retes, archbishop of Mexico’s primatial see, is known as the “Mexican Francis” for his similarities to the Argentine Pope in governance and teaching. Close to Mexican politics, particularly the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) which dominated Mexico’s political landscape in the twentieth century but is now a much weaker political force, he is a low-profile scripture scholar and prominent figure in the Latin American Church. Born on January 9, 1950, in Tepic, Nayarit (Mexico), from an early age he showed an inclination towards religious life, which led him to enter the diocesan minor seminary of Tepic at the age of eleven. He completed his studies in Humanities and Philosophy at the age of nineteen and continued his formation at the Pontifical Mexican Central Seminary of Our Lady of Guadalupe located in Montezuma, New Mexico (USA), and at the Seminary of Tula in Hidalgo, Mexico.1 Ordained a priest on April 22, 1973, Retes soon devoted himself mainly to pastoral work and education, working as a teacher, formator and rector at the Tepic Seminary. In 1977, he was sent to Rome to continue his studies, obtaining a licentiate in Sacred Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute and a doctorate in Biblical Theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University, with a thesis on “The Prophet’s Critique on Fasting” [La crítica de los profetas al ayuno]. He was a student of the progressive Italian Jesuit and biblical scholar Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini. Aguiar Retes’ aspirations were always to the academic life, and his plans were to dedicate himself to the formation of priests and young people through an academic career. However, in May 1997 Pope John Paul II appointed him bishop of Texcoco and he was consecrated a month later. During his time in Texcoco, a diocese very close to Mexico City, Carlos Aguiar Retes was characterized by two key aspects: first, his concern for ongoing priestly formation, both theological and pastoral; and second, his concern for social justice and addressing the needs of the most vulnerable communities. In 2009, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him archbishop of Tlalnepantla, a leading archdiocese located in the Mexico City Metropolitan Area. As archbishop, Aguiar Retes was known for his efforts in launching a diocesan-wide project of evangelization and pastoral renewal, through which he sought to implement the Second Vatican Council and respond to the call for a new evangelization. He also focused on making pastoral visits to all the parishes of the archdiocese, religious communities, schools and universities of Tlalnepantla, with the aim of getting to know more deeply the reality of which he was pastor and to encourage the active participation of the community. On December 7, 2017, Pope Francis appointed Carlos Aguiar Retes as Archbishop Primate of Mexico, succeeding Cardinal Norberto Rivera Carrera. He took possession of the archdiocese on February 5, 2018. Pope Francis elevated him to the cardinalate on November 19, 2016. As Archbishop of Mexico City, he has continued his work, focusing primarily on the renewal of the Church, attention to the neediest, and dialogue with political parties. Retes has taken part in every Vatican synod since 2012. From 2006 to 2012, he was president of Mexico’s bishops’ conference, having already served as its vice president and secretary general. But the cardinal is perhaps best known for his work with CELAM (Consejo Episcopal Latinoamericano y Caribeño), and his work with Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio on the famous Aparecida Document that has played such a significant influence on Francis’ pontificate and evangelization efforts. Then-bishop Retes worked closely with Cardinal Bergoglio to overcome conservative opposition to the document.2 The Cardinal is a cultured man who enjoys painting and music and maintains relations with the world of art and culture. It is believed that his personal friendship with Pope Francis played a key role in his being appointed Primate of Mexico. But Cardinal Retes has drawn some controversy, most notably on financial matters which observers say are connected with a taste for luxury. These controversies, which have cast a shadow over his pastoral governance, comprise imposing a tax on clergy which was criticized by civil and canon law experts, and demanding a fee from parishes that ended up in episcopal coffers. He also oversaw a controversial dividing-up of the archdiocese, and the unannounced withdrawal of medical insurance for diocesan clergy, including for his predecessor who was hospitalized with Covid. Cardinal Carlos Aguiar Retes is close to Pope Francis and generally averse to conflict and confrontation, preferring dialogue. His stance towards Mexico’s current leftist government is that the Church wants to be a “collaborator but not an accomplice.” Throughout his ecclesiastical career, Aguiar Retes has shown himself to be a hybrid character: outwardly moderate and conservative, progressive on certain issues, and deeply aligned with the positions of Pope Francis. Perhaps the adjective to best describe him is “pragmatist,” with a form of governance that places a premium on utility and pragmatic diplomacy, similar to that of an apostolic nuncio. Those acquainted with Mexican politics, however, say his pragmatism echoes that of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) to which the cardinal is deeply linked. The cardinal has voiced clear opposition to abortion and to same-sex marriage, but with some ambiguity relating to the latter, as he has also clearly supported same-sex unions. Like Francis, he strives to be pastoral and avoid confrontation when it comes to neuralgic secular issues, trying instead to strike a balance between the defense of Catholic values and the need to maintain an open dialogue with an increasingly secular society. This diplomatic, non-confrontational approach has allowed him to maintain a relatively stable relationship with the government and other sectors of society, avoiding the open conflicts that have characterized some of his predecessors. Preferring to work behind the scenes, he has focused on the internal administration of the Church and the formation of the clergy, rather than seeking media attention. This attitude has earned him both praise and criticism: while some laud his discretion, others question his lack of visible leadership in times of social or political crisis. In short, Cardinal Carlos Aguiar Retes is a cautious, generally progressive, and diplomatic leader of the Church in Mexico and a key Church figure in Latin America. An inconspicuous pragmatist, he takes calculated risks when it comes to difficult issues and is very favorable to the post-conciliar Church.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Aguiar Retes embodies a pragmatic approach to theology, balancing traditional Catholic values with a desire for dialogue in an increasingly secular society.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is characterized by a non-confrontational and diplomatic style, often preferring behind-the-scenes negotiations to direct conflict.  
• Power Base: His connections to both the Institutional Revolutionary Party and the Vatican, along with his leadership roles in the Latin American Church, bolster his influence within the Church and political spheres.  
• Core Motivation: Driven by a commitment to social justice and pastoral renewal, he seeks to address the needs of vulnerable communities while maintaining the Church's relevance in contemporary society.","Cardinal Carlos Aguiar Retes exemplifies a pragmatic theological approach, skillfully integrating traditional Catholic values with a commitment to dialogue amidst a secularizing world.

5,George Alencherry,"Cardinal George Alencherry, also known as Mar George Cardinal Alencherry, is a prominent figure in the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church who late in his episcopal career became embroiled in financial and liturgical disputes. Born on 19 April 1945 in Thuruthy, in the archdiocese of Changanacherry, India, he is the sixth of ten children to Philipose and Mary Alencherry. His baptismal name is Geevarghese. Alencherry attended St. Mary’s School in Thuruthy for his primary education and St. Berchman’s High School in Changanacherry for his secondary education. He entered the archdiocesan minor seminary at Parel, Changanacherry, in 1961 and later studied at St. Joseph’s Pontifical Seminary in Aluva. His academic achievements include a BA in economics from St. Berchman’s College, a master’s degree from the Pontifical Institute of Theology and Philosophy, and a doctorate in biblical theology from Sorbonne University. He also specialized in catechetics at the Catholic Institute in Paris. Alencherry was ordained a priest on 18 December 1972 by Cardinal Antony Padiyara. His early roles included serving as vicar of the filial church at Periyarmugham and as assistant vicar at the Cathedral Church of Changanacherry. He also served as the director of the Archdiocesan Faith Formation Department, secretary of the Commission for Catechism of the Kerala Catholic Bishops’ Council (KCBC), and deputy secretary of the KCBC. In addition to his pastoral duties, Alencherry was a professor at St. Thomas Apostolic Seminary in Vadavathoor until 1997 and served as protosyncellus (vicar general) of the Archdiocese of Changanacherry from 1994 to 1996. On 11 November 1996, Pope John Paul II established the Diocese of Thuckalay, and Alencherry was appointed its first bishop. He was ordained bishop on 2 February 1997. Later, on 24 May 2011, Alencherry was elected Major Archbishop of the Syro-Malabar Church by its synod, succeeding Varkey Vithayathil. He became the first head of the Syro-Malabar Church to be elected by its synod. In recognition of his leadership, Pope Benedict XVI created Alencherry a cardinal on 18 February 2012, granting him the title of San Bernardo alle Terme. Over the years, Cardinal Alencherry has held several prominent roles. He served as secretary of the Syro-Malabar Synod of Bishops, chairman of the Commission for Laity of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI), and President of the Synod of the Syro-Malabar Church. He also participated in key Vatican events, including the conclave that elected Pope Francis in 2013, as well as the 2014 and 2015 Vatican Synods on the Family. Academically, Alencherry is proficient in Malayalam, Tamil, English, and French, and has authored a book titled “Morality Today and Tomorrow” in Malayalam. In 2023, Cardinal Alencherry became embroiled in a significant liturgical dispute within the Syro-Malabar Church. The Church’s synod, under his leadership, decided to standardize the celebration of Mass, which faced opposition from clergy and laity who preferred the existing practice of celebrating Mass facing the people. This conflict escalated into a major crisis, leading to protests, public boycotts, and even violence in churches. The dispute became so severe that the Vatican intervened, appointing an apostolic administrator for Alencherry’s diocese, although he formally remained the archbishop. Another major controversy involving Cardinal Alencherry began in 2016, surrounding a land deal that led to allegations of cheating, breach of trust, and conspiracy. The cardinal was implicated in the scandal but denied any wrongdoing. In March 2023, the Supreme Court of India dismissed his plea to quash the criminal cases against him, and the case remains ongoing. Cardinal George Alencherry resigned as Major Archbishop on 7 December 2023, citing health reasons. His tenure has been marked by both significant achievements and challenges, reflecting his influential role in the Syro-Malabar Catholic Church.","• Theology/Ideology: Alencherry advocates for a standardized approach to liturgy within the Syro-Malabar Church, emphasizing uniformity over traditional practices.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He exhibits a resolute and authoritative demeanor, which has both rallied support and provoked opposition among clergy and laity.  
• Power Base: Alencherry's influence stems from his leadership roles within the Syro-Malabar Church and his connections in the Vatican, despite recent controversies undermining his authority.  
• Core Motivation: His primary drive appears to be the modernization and cohesion of the Syro-Malabar Church, even at the expense of significant internal conflict.","Cardinal George Alencherry has been a prominent advocate for a standardized approach to liturgy within the Syro-Malabar Church, prioritizing uniformity to foster cohesion and modernization.

6,Fridolin Ambongo Besungu,"Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo Besungu, O.F.M. Cap., the Archbishop of Kinshasa, is a passionate promoter of social justice who fearlessly engages in politics on behalf of the poor and the voiceless, but whose approach to mission and other crucial issues appears contradictory. He was born on January 24, 1960 in Boto in the rural Province of Nord-Ubangi in the Democratic Republic of Congo, into a large catholic family of eleven siblings; his father was a rubber tree tapper. Fridolin studied philosophy at the seminary of Bwamanda, and theology at the Institut Saint-Eugène-de-Mazenod in Congo, before joining the Capuchin Friars Minor in 1981 and professed final vows in 1987. He was ordained priest on August 14, 1988. Following his ordination, he became a professor at the Facultés Catholiques de Kinshasa (now the Université Catholique du Congo). He studied moral theology at the Alphonsian Academy in Rome and in 1995 defended his university dissertation in moral theology entitled La réhabilitation de l’humain, base de développement vrai au Zaïre. Pour une éthique de développement integral (Rehabilitating the human being as the basis for true development in Zaire. For an ethic of integral development). He taught moral theology at the Mazenod Institute (from 1995 to 2005). John Paul II appointed him Bishop of Bokungu-Ikela in 2004. Twelve years later, in 2016, he became Archbishop of Mbandaka-Bikoro, and then Coadjutor Archbishop of Kinshasa in 2018. He was elevated to Archbishop of Kinshasa in November of the same year. Archbishop Ambongo was created a cardinal by Pope Francis during the consistory of October 5, 2019. The following year, the Holy Father appointed him a member of the Council of Cardinals. Since February 2023, he has served as president of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar (SECAM). His prominent position in the Catholic Church in Africa goes hand in hand with his involvement in politics in Congo, where he is seen not only as the leader of the Catholic Church in Africa and a potential papabile, but also as a leader of political opposition to President Félix-Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo. The cardinal, who describes himself as a “sentinel,” is outspoken in his criticism of the government. Ambongo has become so vociferous that in early 2024 the public prosecutor of the Congolese Court of Cassation accused him of “seditious behavior leading to criminal acts” for having failed to encourage the Congolese army in its fight in the eastern part of the country. By the end of April, the local episcopate had downplayed the proceedings.1 Cardinal Ambongo is clear headed when it comes to politics and social justice issues, whether it be neo-colonialism, the exploitation of Congo’s natural resources, wealth inequality, corruption, or protecting the environment. On matters related to the faith and the Church he can also appear decidedly orthodox: he staunchly defends the family, priestly celibacy, and the Church’s moral teaching. He was famously resistant on behalf of most African bishops to Fiducia Supplicans, and deftly negotiated with the Vatican an opt out from the declaration. But his thinking can also often appear muddled and contradictory. He defends Catholic identity and underlines the importance of mission but is content for Protestants to remain Protestant, Muslims to remain Muslim, and implies baptism is unnecessary for salvation. He recognizes the decline of Western Christian civilization but views the current pontificate as resembling the “young Church” of the future, even though many critics of this pontificate say it has too often embraced the secular values that have precipitated the West’s decline. He has voiced concerns about superficial evangelization but then chooses to focus primarily on human dignity, social issues and culture rather than the sacraments and the sacrifice of the Mass (our research also shows he has made no comments and reflections on the interior life). He believes the key to the Church’s future is synodality which he firmly believes is a “new way of being Church,” but he appears oblivious to the synodal process being used by many of its protagonists to further the very agendas he has consistently and vehemently opposed. Cardinal Ambongo has a firm and passionate belief in Africa and what the continent can offer the Church and the world. He is a strong proponent of inculturation and the Zairian rite, and sees evangelization just as necessary for his homeland as for the regressive new mission territories of the West. His own archdiocese, however, has a poor record in attracting vocations on a continent where they are reportedly growing fastest. Under Ambongo’s watch, numbers of priests and religious have plummeted. Cardinal Ambongo has many strengths and has often been touted as papabile in recent years, but as our research shows, question marks abound.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Ambongo promotes a vision of social justice intertwined with a commitment to traditional Catholic teachings, emphasizing human dignity and the importance of inculturation.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is an outspoken and passionate advocate for the marginalized, yet his views on Church doctrine can appear inconsistent, particularly regarding interfaith relations.

7,Ennio Antonelli,"Cardinal Ennio Antonelli, the Archbishop Emeritus of Florence, is a moderate conservative with a strong interest in social justice and peace issues who held several significant positions within the Church hierarchy. Born on November 18, 1936, in Todi, Umbria, Italy, Antonelli was ordained as a priest for the Diocese of Todi on April 2, 1960. He holds a doctorate in classical studies from the University of Perugia and a licentiate in sacred theology from the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome. Cardinal Antonelli was chaplain of the Catholic Teachers’ Association and of various Catholic Action groups, and also served as a seminary rector. He taught literature and art history and lectured in dogmatic theology at the theological institute of Assisi, and was likewise deeply involved in parish activities. Antonelli’s ecclesiastical career has been marked by a series of important appointments. He was appointed Bishop of Gubbio on May 25, 1982, and ordained on August 29 of the same year. During his tenure, he built a new seminary, a diocesan pastoral center, and a house for the clergy. On October 6, 1988, he was promoted to Archbishop of Perugia-Città della Pieve. From 1995 to 2001, he served as the Secretary General of the Italian Bishops’ Conference. On March 21, 2001, Antonelli was appointed Archbishop of Florence, a position he held until 2008. He was elevated to cardinal by Pope John Paul II on October 21, 2003, with the title of Sant’ Andrea delle Fratte. Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as President of the Pontifical Council for the Family on June 7, 2008, a role he held until his retirement on June 26, 2012. Cardinal Antonelli participated in the conclaves of April 2005 and March 2013, which elected Popes Benedict XVI and Francis, respectively. During the 2005 papal conclave, he was considered a papabile. Throughout his career, he has been appointed to various Vatican congregations, including the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants and the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. Antonelli is generally seen as a moderate conservative with a strong interest in social justice and peace issues. His views on certain matters have been notable. In the 1990s, when there were demands for the Church to denounce divorced political candidates, Antonelli suggested that the Church should focus more on their voting records. In 2009, following an Italian court decision equating cohabitation with marriage, he emphasized the societal benefits of traditional families and the disadvantages of single-parent and cohabiting couples. Cardinal Antonelli’s moderate stance and focus on social issues have been consistent themes throughout his career. He has made significant contributions to the Catholic Church in various leadership roles, advocating for social justice while maintaining traditional Church teachings. His work has spanned from local diocesan initiatives to high-level Vatican appointments, reflecting a career dedicated to serving the Church and addressing contemporary social challenges.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Antonelli is a moderate conservative who emphasizes social justice and the importance of traditional family structures within Church teachings.

8,Celestino Aós Braco,"Cardinal Celestino Aós Braco is a Spanish-born retired Archbishop of Santiago de Chile who has been working to restore credibility to the Church in Chile after its reputation was hit by the clerical sex abuse crisis. Born on April 6, 1945, in Artaiz, Spain, he joined the Capuchin Franciscan order and took his final vows in 1967. He was ordained as a priest on March 30, 1968, and initially worked in Spain as a professor and vicar. Aós Braco’s academic background includes studying philosophy in Zaragoza and theology in Pamplona. He also earned a licentiate in psychology from the University of Barcelona in 1980. This psychological training would later prove significant in his career. In 1983, Aós Braco moved to Chile, where he would spend most of his ecclesiastical career. He served in various roles, including parochial vicar, superior of the Capuchin community, and episcopal vicar for consecrated life. His expertise in canon law led to appointments as a judge and promoter of justice in ecclesiastical tribunals. Pope Francis appointed Aós Braco as Bishop of Copiapó in 2014, a role he found surprising given his unfamiliarity with the region. His most significant appointment came on March 23, 2019, when Pope Francis named him Apostolic Administrator of the Archdiocese of Santiago, Chile. This appointment came at a crucial time for the Chilean Church, which was facing a severe credibility crisis due to sexual abuse scandals. On December 27, 2019, Pope Francis elevated Aós Braco to Archbishop of Santiago, and on November 28, 2020, he was created a cardinal, and assigned the titular church of Santi Nereo e Achilleo in Rome. Aós Braco’s tenure has not been without controversy. In 2007, while serving as promoter of justice in Valparaiso, he dismissed a sexual abuse complaint against a former seminary rector as “implausible.” This decision was later scrutinized in light of the later revelations about widespread abuse in the Chilean Church. Another controversy arose in April 2019 when Aós Braco initially refused Holy Communion to people who knelt to receive the Eucharist, causing some distress. He later apologized for any perceived humiliation and clarified his stance on receiving communion in different postures.1 Aós Braco has been working to restore credibility to the Chilean Church. He has emphasized the need for profound purification and reform, stating that superficial changes are inadequate. He has also taken steps to address the abuse crisis, such as deciding not to appeal court verdicts awarding compensation to abuse victims Cardinal Aós Braco is fluent in Spanish, his native language. Given his Spanish origin and long tenure in Chile, it’s likely he speaks both Castilian Spanish and Chilean Spanish. His academic background in Barcelona and research at the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile suggest he may have some proficiency in Catalan and possibly English.","• Theology/Ideology: Aós Braco emphasizes the need for profound purification and reform within the Church, advocating for substantial changes in response to the clerical sex abuse crisis.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He demonstrates a capacity for reflection and adaptation, as evidenced by his apology regarding the initial refusal of Holy Communion to kneeling congregants.

9,Anders Arborelius,"“I would like to point out […] a man who is a model of guidance: Cardinal Anders Arborelius. He is not afraid of anything. He talks to everybody and is not against anybody. He always aims for the positive. I believe that a person like him can indicate the right path to follow.” — Pope Francis in conversation with editors of European Jesuit journals, Rome 2022. Cardinal Anders Arborelius is the Bishop of Stockholm, the only Catholic diocese in Sweden, spanning the entire country. Born on 24 September 1949 in Sorengo, Switzerland, he was raised Lutheran and grew up in Lund, Sweden. He converted to Catholicism in 1969, at the age of 20, in Malmö and joined the Carmelite monastery in Norraby in 1971, professing perpetual vows in Bruges, Belgium, six years later.1 He was ordained a priest in Malmö on 8 September 1979. Arborelius was consecrated Bishop of Stockholm by Pope John Paul II in December 1998, becoming the first ethnic Catholic Swedish bishop since the Protestant Reformation. Since then, he has arguably become the most prominent Catholic in Sweden, having served as its only Ordinary for nearly three decades. From 2005 to 2015, he was president of the Episcopal Conference of Scandinavia, and was elected vice-president in 2015. He was also a member of the Commission of the Presidency of the Pontifical Council for the Family from 2002 to 2009. In 2017, Pope Francis elevated Arborelius to the cardinalate, the first ever from Sweden and Scandinavia. Cardinal Arborelius holds a Master of Arts in modern languages from Lund University and has studied Theology and Philosophy in Bruges and Rome, where he obtained a Licentiate in Spirituality at the Carmelite Pontifical Theological Faculty (Teresianum). He is a member of several Vatican dicasteries, including those for the Clergy, Bishops, Oriental Churches, Promoting Christian Unity, and the Council for the Economy. In June 2022, he was awarded a medal by the King of Sweden for his significant contributions to Church life. He has authored several books in Swedish, focusing on spirituality and biographies of notable religious figures. A mild-mannered and deeply reflective prelate, Cardinal Arborelius has a great devotion to the Holy Eucharist, is orthodox on the teachings of Christ, and fosters a sincere devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary. He upholds the Church’s teachings on life, defends priestly celibacy and opposes women’s ordination. He has also been outspoken in his criticisms of the German Synodal Way and has strongly defended the universally applicable and unchanging nature of the Church’s moral teaching, specifically regarding sexual ethics and gender. The Cardinal takes a more pragmatic view on other issues such as interreligious dialogue and ecumenism which he promotes, although he opposes non-Catholics receiving the Eucharist. Like many of his countrymen, he has a fervent concern for the environment, going so far as to support an international law against “ecocide.” He aligns with Pope Francis on migration. On the liturgy, he surprised many by his implementation of Traditionis Custodes, suppressing the vetus ordo (Old Latin Mass) in some parishes. In spite of being aware of its popularity among the young and with young families, and its source of many vocations, the cardinal has allegedly found it hard to understand “why people want the TLM.” He opposes labels such as “traditional” or “liberal” Catholic — a trend he sees as politicizing religion which he considers “very dangerous.” Despite rampant secularism in Sweden, his diocese has witnessed a slight growth in the number of vocations during his tenure as bishop, and an increase in Church attendance, largely helped by the extent of immigration in the country. And despite social unrest caused by extensive immigration into Sweden, violence he has condemned several times, Cardinal Arborelius remains a proponent of immigration including of many Muslims, and calls for dialogue and greater integration rather than for any restrictions to be placed on immigration levels. Cardinal Arborelius has said that his episcopal motto In Laudem Gloriae (Unto the Praise of Glory) “is an expression of all that I am — to give glory to the Triune God.” He believes that in our time, man’s “first duty and our privilege” to “honor and glorify God” has been forgotten. “Man is not reduced by it, on the contrary, he grows, becomes more free and happier. One of my greatest desires is to help people discover this.”2 The Swedish cardinal confesses to not being a careerist in any way and expressed surprise at being made a cardinal, thinking at first that it was a joke; but he has since tried to “make the best of the situation” and to “interpret it as God’s will.” Those who know Cardinal Arborelius describe him as genuinely meek and humble, an attentive listener who has been praised for remaining calm and faithful to the Church’s teaching, such as when provoked by atheists on television. This has won him the respect of both Catholics and non-Catholics. Cardinal Arborelius’ achilles heel appears to be a weak governing style. He is known for his strong desire to avoid conflict at all costs, according to clergy and laymen who know him well, leading to a style of leadership that has caused problems during his 27-year tenure. The cardinal’s favorite saint is Thérèse of the Child Jesus. He has a preference for silent, wordless prayer, and enjoys detective stories and cooking. Asked if he was ready to be Pope one day, he said: “No, I can’t say that. Because it’s so unrealistic. But it’s true – it’s a possibility.” Cardinal Arborelius is a proficient linguist having received a Master’s degree in modern languages from Lund University. As well as his native Swedish, he speaks fluent English, Spanish, French, German, and Dutch.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Anders Arborelius upholds orthodox Catholic teachings, emphasizing devotion to the Eucharist and the Virgin Mary while opposing women's ordination and supporting traditional moral teachings.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his mild-mannered and humble demeanor, Arborelius is an attentive listener who promotes dialogue and integration, though he tends to avoid conflict in leadership.

10,Francis Arinze,"Cardinal Francis Arinze is a retired senior Vatican official with fervent orthodox views who has had a long and distinguished career in the Church spanning several decades. Born on November 1, 1932, in Eziowelle, Nigeria, into a family that practiced traditional African religion, at the age of 9, on November 1, 1941 (his birthday), young Francis made the decision to convert to Catholicism. This was not due to pressure from adults or others around him, but rather of his own volition and through what he believed to be the grace of God. The person who received Arinze into the Catholic faith was Blessed Cyprian Tansi, who was serving as a parish priest at the time. Blessed Tansi’s example of holiness left a lasting impression on the young Arinze, particularly in teaching him to recognize and love Christ’s presence in the Eucharist. He then began his journey to priesthood at a young age, studying at All Hallows Seminary in Nuewi before pursuing philosophy and theology at Bigard Memorial Seminary and the Pontifical Urban University in Rome. Arinze was ordained priest in 1958 and quickly rose through the ranks of the Church hierarchy. In 1965, at the age of 32, he became the youngest Roman Catholic bishop in the world when he was appointed titular bishop of Fissiana and coadjutor to the archbishop of Onitsha, Nigeria. He attended the final session of the Second Vatican Council that same year, marking the beginning of his involvement in global Church affairs. One of the most challenging periods in Arinze’s career came shortly after he was named archbishop of Onitsha in 1967. The Nigeria-Biafra War broke out, and his entire archdiocese was located in the secessionist Biafran territory. During this time, Arinze demonstrated remarkable leadership, aiding refugees and supervising an efficient distribution of relief materials. He managed to keep the Church independent of the warring factions, showcasing his diplomatic skills. Arinze’s talents were recognized by the Vatican, and in 1984, he was called to Rome by Pope John Paul II to lead the Secretariat for Non-Christians (later renamed the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue). This appointment marked the beginning of his long and distinguished career in the Roman Curia. In 1985, Arinze was elevated to the rank of cardinal, becoming a key advisor to Pope John Paul II. He served in various capacities, including as president of the Special Assembly for Africa of the Synod of Bishops. His work in interfaith relations earned him a gold medallion from the International Council of Christians and Jews in 1999. In 2002, Arinze was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, a position he held until 2008. This role made him the fourth highest-ranking official in the Roman Curia at the time. Arinze was considered a strong papabile candidate in the 2005 conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. Although he was not elected, he remained a respected figure in the Church. Benedict XVI elevated him to Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni in 2005, a role traditionally held by papabili. Even after his retirement as prefect in 2008, Arinze continued to play important roles in the Church. In 2009, he was called to preach the spiritual exercises for the Roman Curia, which Pope Benedict XVI attended. He took part in two synods of bishops, on the Eucharist in 2005, and on Africa in 2009. Cardinal Arinze holds orthodox Catholic views, especially on matters of life, the family, and sexuality. He emphasizes adherence to established Church teachings and scripture rather than advocating for changes to accommodate modern societal trends. In 2022, he rejected the claims of two influential cardinals — Reinhard Marx and Jean-Claude Hollerich — who had suggested that Catholic moral teachings were negotiable or even false, with Marx asserting that the teachings of the Church are “not set in stone”. “It is not wise for a Catholic bishop or priest or, worse, a cardinal, to suggest that,” Cardinal Arinze said. “If the cardinal who said that was thinking about homosexuality, he cannot be supported at all.”1 Now into his 90s, he continues to occasionally speak out in defense of the faith, often with his characteristic good humor.2 He may also wield considerable influence at the next conclave. Throughout his career, Cardinal Arinze has been known for his frankness, his work in interfaith dialogue, and his orthodox positions on Church doctrine.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Francis Arinze holds fervently orthodox views, emphasizing adherence to established Church teachings and scripture without accommodating modern societal trends.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his frankness and diplomatic skills, Arinze effectively managed Church operations during the Nigeria-Biafra War while maintaining independence from political factions.  
• Power Base: Having served in high-ranking positions within the Roman Curia and as a cardinal, Arinze has cultivated a significant influence and respect among Church leadership.  
• Core Motivation: Arinze is driven by a commitment to uphold traditional Catholic values, particularly regarding life, family, and sexuality, which he believes are non-negotiable.","Cardinal Francis Arinze is a distinguished member of the Church, recognized for his steadfast commitment to orthodox teachings and traditional Catholic values.

11,Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel,"Il Cardinale Felipe Arizmendi Esquivel è un Vescovo messicano in pensione di San Cristóbal de Las Casas, che ha dato un contributo significativo all’impegno della Chiesa verso le comunità indigene in Messico. Nato il 1° maggio 1940 a Chiltepec, in Messico, Arizmendi Esquivel è stato ordinato sacerdote nel 1963. Ha servito come rettore del seminario nella Diocesi di Toluca prima di essere nominato Vescovo di Tapachula da Papa Giovanni Paolo II nel 1991. Ha fatto parte di diverse commissioni e consigli diocesani ed è diventato segretario generale del Celam nel 1991. Nel 2000, è stato trasferito a diventare Vescovo di San Cristóbal de Las Casas in Chiapas, una posizione che ha ricoperto fino a quando le sue dimissioni sono state accettate da Papa Francesco nel 2017. Il Cardinale Arizmendi Esquivel è conosciuto soprattutto per il suo lavoro di costruzione della Chiesa indigena in Messico, in particolare nella Diocesi di San Cristóbal de Las Casas. Ha continuato il lavoro pastorale del suo predecessore, il Vescovo Samuel Ruiz, concentrandosi sulla creazione di una Chiesa autoctona che rispettasse e incorporasse le culture indigene. Uno dei suoi risultati più significativi è stato guidare le iniziative dei vescovi messicani per tradurre la Bibbia in varie lingue indigene. Sotto la sua guida, la Bibbia completa è stata tradotta in Tzeltal nel 2003 e in Tzotzil (variante Zinacantán) nel 2015. Nel 2024, è stata realizzata una traduzione completa nello Tzotzil dell’area di San Juan Chamula, parlato da circa 350.000 persone. Nel 2013, Arizmendi Esquivel ha presentato con successo una petizione a Papa Francesco per rivedere il tema dell’ordinazione di diaconi indigeni, che era stata proibita dal Vaticano per oltre un decennio. Questo ha portato alla ripresa di tali ordinazioni poco dopo. Ha ospitato Papa Francesco durante la sua visita in Chiapas nel febbraio 2016, nonostante la resistenza iniziale del governo messicano. Durante questa visita, il Papa si è scusato per la ‘spoliazione’ subita dai popoli indigeni. È stato descritto come “uno dei pochi vescovi in Messico che è pienamente d’accordo con il Papa”. Si dice anche che il cardinale non “creda nella teologia della liberazione, ma creda in una Chiesa per i poveri”, e che si concentri sulla “democrazia, l’ecologia e il tema delle vittime della violenza”. In riconoscimento del suo lavoro, Papa Francesco ha nominato Arizmendi Esquivel nel Collegio Cardinalizio nell’ottobre 2020, anche se a causa della sua età (oltre 80 anni), non potrà votare nel prossimo conclave. Arizmendi Esquivel è stato descritto come un “modernizzatore” e, sebbene il suo lavoro sia stato lodato, non è stato privo di controversie. Il suo progetto di costruire una chiesa nativa in una diocesi prevalentemente indigena ha causato conflitti con la gerarchia della Chiesa e con i proprietari terrieri. La pratica di ordinare diaconi uomini sposati e indigeni è stata particolarmente controversa, con alcuni leader della Chiesa che temevano di indebolire il ruolo dei sacerdoti o di aprire la porta a sacerdoti sposati. Il Cardinale Arizmendi Esquivel parla spagnolo e conosce diverse lingue indigene del Messico, in particolare quelle parlate in Chiapas come lo Tzeltal e lo Tzotzil.","• Theology/Ideology: Arizmendi Esquivel emphasizes a Church for the poor, advocating for indigenous rights and cultural integration rather than liberation theology.

12,Raymundo Damasceno Assis,"Cardinal Raymundo Damasceno Assis is a retired Brazilian prelate who has held a number of leadership positions in the Church in Latin America. Born on February 15, 1937, in Capela Nova, Brazil, Damasceno Assis began his religious education at a young age, entering the Juvenato São José of the Marist Brothers in 1948. He later studied philosophy at the Major Seminary of the archdiocese of Mariana. In 1961, he was sent to Rome to study theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he obtained a licentiate. He also studied in Germany, completing his formation at the Superior Institute of Catechesis in Munich. Ordained a priest on March 19, 1968, Damasceno Assis served in various roles in the archdiocese of Brasília, including coordinator of catechesis, pastor, and chancellor. He was also a professor at the Major Seminary Nossa Senhora de Fatima and the University of Brasília. His rise through the Church hierarchy began with his appointment as auxiliary bishop of Brasília in 1986. In 2004, he became the archbishop of Aparecida, a position he held until his retirement in 2016. Pope Benedict XVI elevated him to the rank of Cardinal in 2010. Throughout his career, Cardinal Damasceno Assis has held several significant leadership positions. He served as president of the Episcopal Council of Latin America (CELAM) from 2007 to 2011 and as president of the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil from 2011 to 2015. He was also one of the cardinal electors who participated in the 2013 papal conclave that selected Pope Francis. He also took part in both the 2014 and 2015 synods on the family. Latterly, Cardinal Damasceno Assis was involved in a notable controversy concerning the Heralds of the Gospel, an international association of the faithful. In 2019, Pope Francis appointed him as the pontifical commissioner for the Heralds of the Gospel and its male and female branches. This appointment came after an apostolic visitation revealed concerns about the group’s practices, including unconventional exorcism rituals and a personality cult surrounding its founder. Cardinal Damasceno Assis is known to speak Portuguese, his native language. Given his education in Rome and Germany, it’s likely he also has knowledge of Italian and German, though this is not explicitly stated in the available sources. Throughout his career, Cardinal Damasceno Assis has been recognized for his leadership in the Latin American Church and his efforts to address issues within religious organizations. His appointment as pontifical commissioner for the Heralds of the Gospel demonstrated the trust placed in him by Pope Francis to handle sensitive matters within the Church.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Damasceno Assis is known for his commitment to addressing contemporary issues within the Church, emphasizing pastoral care and social justice in Latin America.

13,Jean-Marc Aveline,"Cardinal Jean-Marc Noël Aveline, the Archbishop of Marseille and allegedly Pope Francis’ “favorite” cardinal to succeed him, is an affable, heterodox-leaning prelate with broad appeal who is dedicated to issues of migration and interreligious dialogue. He comes from a family of pieds-noirs, an ethno-cultural people of French and other European descent who settled in Algeria when the country was under French colonial rule. He was born in the Algerian town of Sidi bel Abbès, a town that once housed the headquarters of the French Foreign Legion, on December 26, 1958. In 1962, when he was just four years old, he and his peers were forced into exile after Algeria gained independence following a bloody war. Like all repatriates, he and his family wandered from hotel to hotel, first arriving in Villejuif near Paris, then in Marseille, where they settled in 1965. It was there that his family finally found some stability, and it was due to this traumatic childhood that he retained a particular concern for migrants and a sensitivity to the theme of exile.  Aveline’s father was an employee with SNCF (French state railway), and he grew up in Marseille’s northern neighborhoods, the poorest in this cosmopolitan metropolis that he would never leave. In 1975, he passed his baccalaureate in Marseille, and two years later entered the seminary in Avignon. He was influenced by the poet and mystic Father Jean Arnaud, co-founder of the Workers’ Mission in Marseille, who taught him to love “a Marian and eschatological Church,” “a gentle Church, capable of leaving in a hurry for unexpected visits,” but where “Communion comes before organization and mercy prevails over judgment.”  Aveline finished his seminary studies in Paris, at the Carmes seminary. He studied at the Institut Catholique de Paris and graduated with a degree in biblical Greek and Hebrew and theology. At the same time, he studied philosophy at the Sorbonne.  According to Marseille mayor Benoît Payan, quoted in L’Obs magazine, Jean-Marc Aveline is a man of “superior intelligence.” Others have described him as having a naturally good, very astute, and complex character. Aveline was ordained priest on November 3, 1984, for the archdiocese of Marseille. During that time, he became friends with Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, then Archbishop of Marseille, who considered Aveline to be his “spiritual son.” He continued his theology studies up to doctorate level, and in 2000 defended his thesis on the Christology of religions.  Being a scholar, education is particularly close to his heart. Higher education and university research, in particular, are a common thread running through his career. He taught at the inter-diocesan seminary in Marseille, before taking over as Director of Studies. In 1992, on the initiative of Cardinal Robert Coffy, the then-Archbishop of Marseille, he founded the Institut de Science et Théologie des Religions (ISTR) in Marseille, which he directed until 2002. The institute’s mission is to place the Christian faith in the context of “the plurality of cultures and religions,” and invites theology, in a Mediterranean perspective, to be a theology “of welcome and dialogue”. From 1995, he was director of the Institut Saint-Jean, which became the Institut Catholique de la Méditerranée, attached to the Catholic University of Lyon. His profile caught the eye of Benedict XVI who appointed him a member of the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue in 2008. From 2008-2013 he served as vicar general of the archdiocese of Marseille. Thirty years after becoming a priest, on January 26, 2014, he was consecrated auxiliary bishop of Marseille by Archbishop Georges Pontier of Marseille. He succeeded Pontier when Pope Francis appointed him the city’s metropolitan archbishop on August 8, 2019.  Aveline was one of 21 cardinals created by Pope Francis at the consistory of August 27, 2022, making him France’s fifth cardinal-elector at the time. He is seen by some in France as putting an end to a four decade “dynasty” of the late Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger of Paris and heralding the “new era” that Francis often speaks about.  In September 2023, he was responsible for achieving something his brother bishops had failed to do: successfully persuading Pope Francis to visit France — not, as Francis was keen to point out, for a visit to France per se, but rather for a meeting with Mediterranean bishops and youth in Marseille. The visit was highly significant for the cardinal who has been convinced that the issues surrounding the Mediterranean basin are decisive for the future of the world. On April 2, 2025, Cardinal Aveline was elected as the new president of the French Bishops’ Conference (CEF). He will officially take office on July 1. Cardinal Aveline is often portrayed in the French press — Catholic or otherwise — as Pope Francis’ favorite prelate, and is said to be the most “Bergoglian” of France’s bishops. His modest origins, his constant concern for the “peripheries” in his archdiocese of Marseille — a city characterized by its Mediterranean position and its openness to the world along with its large population movements — clearly all play in his favor in the mind of Pope Francis. The two reportedly meet each other at the Vatican regularly, outside official schedules. He is especially well regarded by those on the political and ecclesiastical Left. Having grown up in Marseille where the Muslim community is particularly strong, and where the faithful of many religions live side by side, his personal history makes him very sensitive to the issue of migrants and inter-religious dialogue. Pope Francis in fact considered appointing him prefect of the Dicastery for Interreligious Dialogue but decided instead to have him continue with his pastoral work in Marseille. His views on dialogue between faiths closely mirror those of Pope Francis: an avoidance of conversion efforts and an emphasis instead on the “mystery” of the plurality of religions, experience and friendship, all of which trump theological formulas. On some of the most contentious issues likely to create controversy within the Church — women’s ordination, the questioning of priestly celibacy, access to Communion for remarried divorcees — Cardinal Aveline maintains a cautious attitude and is reluctant to take a clear stand either way. He prefers not to speak about sensitive issues or reveal his political leanings. He adopts a proactive stance on issues that have come to the fore under Pope Francis’ pontificate, such as inter-religious dialogue or the welcome of migrants, without, however, demonstrating any aggressive militancy on these issues. He thus appears as a rather liberal figure, but one inclined to consensus. Aveline favors radical decentralization in the Church, often repeating that the Church’s “center of gravity is not in herself, but in God’s relationship with the world.” On returning from an assembly of French bishops in Lourdes, he said it is “pride that is eating away at the Church” and that “far from stubbornly seeking to protect herself as an institution, she must accept to lose everything in order to gain Christ. Her salvation lies in conversion to the Gospel.”  According to a profile in the progressive Catholic daily La Croix, Cardinal Aveline is regarded as a “real man of prayer,” a “much loved pastor” in his diocese, and as having a “common touch” helped by Mediterranean bonhomie which gives him a reassuringly unifying aura. He is said to be deeply relational and someone who looks for new ways of relating to people. But critics regard some of this thinking as dangerous, distinctly heterodox and modernist. His views, they say, veer into indifferentism, departing from the traditional understanding of the Catholic faith, divine revelation, and the necessity of the Church for salvation. In 2021, Aveline took action to help encourage traditional Catholics after Traditionis Custodes, even celebrating the Old Mass after the document was published. He also worked to mitigate a dispute between a traditional-minded French bishop, with whom he is a friend, and the Vatican. His mediation failed. Since his appointment as Archbishop of Marseille in 2019, vocations numbers have fallen but not significantly, with 198 priests recorded in 2023 (down from 221 in 2019). In 2023, one minor seminarian was listed with nine in major seminary. The diocese has a population of just over a million, of whom 742,000 are listed as Catholic. The cardinal had two siblings, two sisters both of whom have since died: Martine who passed away at the age of 7 months and Marie-Jeanne who died of an aggressive form of cancer in 2011. But his parents are still alive and he helps take care of them and sees them regularly. Some are concerned that having become France’s foremost bishop, the cardinal has too much on his plate, to which he responded: “Each time the weight of your workload is increased, you must lengthen the time of your prayer.” Cardinal Aveline, who was awarded the prestigious Légion d’honneur by French President Emmanuel Macron in 2022, would probably continue to lead the Church in the same direction as Francis but with a lighter, more scholarly and less ideological touch. The question is whether, given Aveline’s relative youth, his brother cardinals would want to continue along that path for what would likely be a long pontificate.","• Theology/Ideology: Aveline advocates for a theology of welcome and dialogue, emphasizing the importance of interreligious relationships and the plurality of cultures.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is described as affable and deeply relational, possessing a common touch that facilitates consensus-building among diverse groups.  
• Power Base: His close relationship with Pope Francis and his role as a prominent bishop in Marseille provide him with significant influence within the Church.

14,João Braz de Aviz,"Cardinal João Braz de Aviz is a progressive-leaning senior Vatican official who since 2012 has served as the prefect of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life. Born on April 24, 1947, in Brazil, he was ordained as a priest in the Diocese of Apucarana, Parana, Brazil on April 26, 1972. Apucurana. He holds a license in theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University and doctorate in dogmatic theology from the Pontifical Lateran University. His leadership qualities were recognized early, leading to his appointment as Auxiliary Bishop of Vitória, Espirito Santo on April 6, 1994. As his influence grew within the Church, he was appointed Archbishop of Brasília ten years later. One of Cardinal Aviz’s significant accomplishments was organizing the XVI Eucharistic National Congress in Brasília in 2010. This event showcased his organizational skills and dedication to promoting Eucharistic devotion among the faithful. In recognition of his service and leadership, João Braz de Aviz was elevated to the rank of Cardinal in 2012 by Benedict XVI. This appointment further solidified his position as a key figure in the Catholic Church hierarchy. Appointed prefect of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in 2012 despite not being a member of a religious order, Cardinal Braz de Aviz has played a crucial role in overseeing matters related to religious orders and congregations within the Catholic Church, and in promoting vocations. In his memoirs, Cardinal Franc Rodé (Braz de Aviz’s predecessor as prefect) expressed astonishment at his appointment, describing him as a “Focolarino fanatic” (member of the Focolare Movement).1 Since taking up the role, Aviz has been criticized by some for having a too conciliatory stance towards religious groups considered liberal or progressive, in contrast to the harder line of his predecessor. He has also been both praised and criticized for his call for a wide-ranging review of structures of Church power. “We are in a moment of needing to review and revision some things,” Braz de Aviz said in 2013. “Obedience and authority must be renewed, re-visioned.” He added: “Authority that commands, kills […] Obedience that becomes a copy of what the other person says, infantilizes.” Like Pope Francis, he is in favor of restricting the Traditional Latin Mass. In 2013, Cardinal Aviz was part of the leadership that implemented restrictions on the Franciscan Friars of the Immaculate (FFI), which included limiting their ability to celebrate the TLM. The decree required explicit authorization for FFI members to use the extraordinary form (Vetus Ordo). In September 2024, Braz de Aviz announced that his dicastery would be undertaking an apostolic visitation of the traditional Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter “in order to deepen their knowledge” of the society of pontifical right and “to offer the most appropriate help in the path of following Christ.” Faithful within the traditional Catholic community view the visitation with trepidation given Traditionis Custodes and the cardinal’s own views on the TLM. While not directly addressing the Vetus Ordo, Cardinal Braz de Aviz has emphasized the importance of “walking together” and a “new style” of unity in the Church, which could be interpreted as favoring the more widely-used Novus Ordo Mass. Under Aviz’s watch, the dicastery also implemented highly controversial changes to contemplative life, especially of female religious. The dicastery’s 2018 Instruction Cor Orans made considerable changes to female contemplative religious life. Critics said the document fundamentally altered in a negative way the nature of contemplative monastic life, especially for more traditional orders. Some argued that it would destroy the autonomy that St. Teresa of Avila insisted was crucial for Carmelite monasteries. However, supporters saw it as necessary reform to address issues concerning formation and ensure the viability of contemplative communities. Cardinal Braz de Aviz also drew controversy for comments he made in 2020 in which he lambasted the state of “dominance” that men often hold over women in the Catholic Church. He also again stressed the need for a deeper renewal of religious life across the board. “In many cases, the relationship between consecrated men and women represents a sick system of relations of submission and dominance that takes away the sense of freedom and joy, a misunderstood obedience,” he said. Aviz has warned that those who distance themselves from the Second Vatican Council “are killing themselves” and will eventually “be outside the Church.” He himself came close to death soon after ordination. As a young priest on his way to celebrate Mass in a nearby village in Brazil, he stumbled upon an armored car robbery and was caught in the crossfire. Bullets perforated his lungs and intestines and one eye. Surgeons were able to save his eye but he still carries fragments of those bullets in his body. As a young priest, Braz de Aviz said in 2011 he was close to abandoning the Catholic Church due to the “ideological excesses” that arose in the early years of liberation theology. For the four years (1998-2002) he was Bishop of Ponta Grossa, the total number of priests in the diocese fell from 130 to 112; male religious numbers dropped from 201 to 144 while numbers of female religious increased from 327 to 360. During his two years (2002-2004) as Archbishop of Maringa, vocations showed marginal differences: priests fell from 65 to 59; male religious increased from 25 to 36, and female religious dropped from 137 to 126. Over the seven years he was Archbishop of Brasilia (2004-2012), the number of priests rose from 249 to 312; male religious numbers fell from 232 to 211, and female religious dropped from 504 to 428. As of writing, Cardinal João Braz de Aviz continues to be an influential figure in the Catholic Church, contributing to the governance and spiritual guidance of religious institutes worldwide through his role as prefect of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life. He speaks Portuguese and Italian.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal João Braz de Aviz advocates for progressive reforms within the Church and emphasizes the importance of revisiting authority and obedience in light of contemporary challenges.

15,Audrys Juozas Bačkis,"Cardinal Audrys Juozas Bačkis is a retired Archishop of Vilnius who led a distinguished career in Vatican diplomacy and ecclesiastical service. Born on February 1, 1937, in Kaunas, Lithuania, Bačkis spent much of his early life in Paris due to his father’s diplomatic career. Bačkis received his education in Paris and Rome and was ordained as a priest in 1961. He obtained a licentiate in theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University and doctorate in Canon Law from the Lateran University. After ordination he began his service in the Kaunas Archdiocese, but in 1964, Bačkis entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See, serving in various capacities in the Philippines, Costa Rica, Turkey, and Nigeria. His diplomatic career culminated in his appointment as Pro-Nuncio to the Netherlands in 1988. Alongside his diplomatic responsibilities, he actively participated in pastoral care by assisting at various parishes, collaborated with religious organizations (especially youth and family), led retreats and discussions. On October 4, 1988, Bačkis was consecrated as a bishop by Pope John Paul II along with Archbishop Achille Silvestrini and Bishop Juozas Preikšas. In 1991, he was appointed Archbishop Metropolitan of Vilnius, a position he held until his retirement in 2013. Pope John Paul II elevated Bačkis to the rank of cardinal on February 21, 2001. He served as the President of the Lithuanian Bishop’s Conference for two terms (1993-1999 and 2002-2005) and was Vice President of the European Bishop’s Synod Member Committee. Bačkis played a crucial role in organizing Pope John Paul II’s apostolic journey to Lithuania in 1993. He has been a member of several important Vatican congregations and committees, including for education and communications. In 1993, he re-established the Vilnius Seminary. In the same year, due to his initiative, a Theology Department was established at the Vilnius Pedagogical Institute, where Religion teachers were trained. He has been a patron of the Faith and Light Community, which helps unite families who are raising disabled children. He helped to build Versmė School, which provides integrated Catholic-oriented education, where children with disabilities study together with healthy children. He is the Spiritual Father of this school. In 1992, he established the Betanija Food Shelter which feeds about 500 people cost-free every day. In 2003, he was presented with the Vytautas Didysis Order’s Great Cross, and on May 13, 2003, he received an Honorary Doctorate from Krakow’s Pontifical Theological Academy. As a cardinal, Bačkis participated in the 2005 and 2013 papal conclaves, and the 2015 Synod on the Family. After his retirement, Pope Francis appointed Bačkis as his Special Envoy to celebrations marking the 1,025th anniversary of the Baptism of the Kievan Rus in Kyiv, Ukraine, in 2013. Cardinal Bačkis is known for his linguistic abilities. Besides his native Lithuanian, he speaks English, French, German, Italian, and Polish.

16,Fabio Baggio,"Cardinal Fabio Baggio, the undersecretary of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, is an Italian missionary and musician who has dedicated himself to the twin concerns of migration and ecology — two priorities which he sees as closely connected. Born on January 15, 1965, in Bassano del Grappa, Italy, he enrolled at a Scalabrian Missionaries’ minor seminary at the age of eleven and made his perpetual profession in 1991. He was ordained priest in 1992. “There was a good atmosphere of brotherhood” in the seminary he recalls. “I loved service to others and had always been attracted by solidarity with the less fortunate. I came from a family that had suffered to survive, and this generated in me a sense of responsibility.” Baggio has a bachelor’s degree in theology and a doctorate in Church history from the Pontifical Gregorian University. He says his theological training was influenced by theologians Karl Rahner, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Joseph Ratzinger, Jean Gallo, and Luis Ladaria Ferrer, as well as by thinkers in the “theology of migration.” The bulk of Cardinal Baggio’s career has been dedicated to migrants and refugees. He has served in various roles across different countries, showcasing his commitment to this cause. In Chile in the 1990s, he worked as a consultant on migration with the Chilean Bishops Conference. Later, he became the Director of the Buenos Aires Archdiocese’s Department of Migration, during which time he collaborated with Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio and formed a lasting friendship. Baggio has taught at several universities in Europe, Latin America, and Asia. He directed the Scalabrini Migration Center in Quezon City, Philippines, and was responsible for the Asian and Pacific Migration Journal from 2002 to 2010. In 2010, he was appointed director of the Scalabrini International Migration Institute (SIMI) in Rome, part of the Pontifical Urbanian University. Since 2013, he has been its dean and a full professor. Cardinal Baggio’s expertise in migration issues led to his appointment in the Vatican. In January 2017, he began serving as co-undersecretary of the migrants and refugees section of the Holy See’s Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development. In April 2022, he was appointed undersecretary of the entire dicastery. In 2021, he was named a member of the Vatican’s COVID-19 commission that controversially promoted the idea that taking the anti-covid jabs was an “act of love.” In 2023, Cardinal Baggio’s responsibilities expanded further when he was chosen to implement the Vatican’s ecological project, the Borgo Laudato Si’, an ecologically focused farming laboratory and training center based in Castel Gandolfo. Its aim is to “promote ecological conversion,” Baggio has said, and to “transition to a circular, generative economy.” The cardinal sees migration and ecology as linked. He said in 2024: “We can’t ignore ecology, because the areas most affected by new atmospheric phenomena, creating desertification, water shortages, etc., are the areas from which even more migrants will come in the future.” Pope Francis elevated Baggio to cardinal on December 7, 2024, having also bestowed on him the personal title of archbishop on October 31, 2024. Baggio was consecrated a bishop on January 11, 2025. He is expected to replace Cardinal Michael Czerny, who will retire soon on age grounds, as head of the dicastery. On April 1, 2025, Pope Francis appointed Cardinal Baggio a member of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See (APSA). Beyond his religious and humanitarian work, Cardinal Baggio is also a musician and composer. He has composed theatrical and electro-pop Christian songs, drawing inspiration from Italian singers of the 70s and 80s, as well as English-language songwriters. His musical tastes range from pop to classical, with favorites including Bach, Beethoven, and Vivaldi. “Music has always accompanied me in my missions,” he says. “Since 2010, however, I’ve had to put the guitar on hold. I continue to listen to a variety of very eclectic genres, and I always say that there will come a time when I may start composing again.” From his international experience, Cardinal Baggio likely speaks Italian (his native language), English, and Spanish.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Baggio emphasizes the interconnectedness of migration and ecology, advocating for a holistic approach to integral human development.

17,Angelo Bagnasco,"Born during World War II and raised in Genoa, Italy, Cardinal Angelo Bagnasco was attracted to the priesthood as a young altar boy; this experience later served him well in his extensive pastoral experience. His family was working-class and wanted him to become an accountant. Angelo, however, wanted to become a priest, and his parish priest helped his parents to accept his vocation. Cardinal Giuseppe Siri, himself once a candidate for the papacy, ordained Bagnasco a priest on June 29, 1966, less than a year after the close of the Second Vatican Council. Rather than go down a bureaucratic route in the Church, Siri ensured that Bagnasco was with the people of the diocese, with a focus on ministering to youth. For over twenty years, Bagnasco served as an assistant parish priest in Genoa, ten years of which he also taught at a seminary. For many years, he worked with university students and secondary school students, including the Scouts, helping supply for their pastoral needs. Later, he continued similar work, directing the catechetical office for the Diocese of Genoa. In 1998, he received episcopal consecration from Archbishop Dionigi Tettamanzi. Bagnasco gained intimate knowledge of Italy through his unique appointment as archbishop of the Military Ordinariate of Italy in 2003, a post which he held until being moved to Genoa as archbishop in 2006, and through his appointment by Benedict XVI as president of the Italian Episcopal Conference — a position he held for a decade from 2007 to 2017. The widespread respect he has enjoyed among his fellow bishops was manifested in their electing him president of the Council of the Bishops’ Conferences of Europe which he led from 2016 until 2021. The Pope accepted Cardinal Bagnasco’s resignation as Archbishop of Genoa in May 2020 at the age of seventy-seven. Cardinal Bagnasco is widely respected as a man of acute intelligence, high culture, profound compassion, and intense spirituality — and someone able to combine these qualities with amiability and a gentle nature. A fervent defender of orthodox Church teaching in the public square in the mold of John Paul II and Benedict XVI, as president of Italy’s bishops’ conference Bagnasco fought hard for the Faith and the Church’s moral teaching in the political arena, at one point requiring bodyguards for his personal protection. For Bagnasco, publicly witnessing to Christian values, including the protection of human life from conception until natural death, is a matter of Christian duty, lending him a prophetic voice in a culture where the majority of Church leaders have fallen silent. “If faith does not become a judgment on man, society and history,” he said in June 2024, “it denies itself.” Cardinal Bagnasco has firmly upheld Humanae Vitae, and in 2014 opposed the “Kasper Proposal” to allow Holy Communion to “remarried” divorcees in some cases, although he did not publicly voice his support for the dubia. He has strongly opposed homosexual civil unions but towards the end of his time as Genoa’s archbishop lacked clarity on homosexual issues more generally. He rejects universalism, opposes an end to mandatory priestly celibacy and ordaining women as deacons, and has spoken out against persecution of Christians. He has long defended Europe’s Christian roots and frequently addressed the clerical sexual abuse crisis, urging an end to cover-ups. He has called for more transparency in Church finances. Cardinal Bagnasco has upheld the importance of the Eucharist and the liturgy and is a supporter of preserving the Traditional Latin Mass. Although now officially retired, in 2021 the Vatican brought Bagnasco out of retirement to investigate abuse allegations against a top Polish prelate. He has also continued to weigh in on issues he sees as important for our times. Like Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI, he has been especially concerned about Europe forgetting its Christian roots. For him, Christ and the Eucharist are crucial to resolving the many problems of Europe and the West, and he is unafraid to say so. Mild mannered, reliable, courageous and discreet, Angelo Bagnasco continues to be viewed as a potential pope, should voting cardinals wish for the papacy to return to its traditional Italian occupant and prefer a safe pair of conservative hands after the internal Church divisions of the Francis years. Apart from his native Italian, Cardinal Bagnasco is not listed as being proficient in speaking any other languages.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Bagnasco is a fervent defender of orthodox Church teaching, emphasizing the protection of human life and traditional values in the face of contemporary challenges.

18,Lorenzo Baldisseri,"Cardinal Lorenzo Baldisseri is a retired senior Vatican diplomat who became best known later in life for playing a key role in organizing the controversial 2014 and 2015 Synods on the Family. Born on September 29, 1940, in Barga, Italy, Baldisseri was ordained as a priest in 1963 at the young age of 22 for the Archdiocese of Pisa. He holds a license in dogmatic theology and a doctorate in canon law, and is also an accomplished pianist who studied at the Pontifical Institute of Sacred Music, and then studied polyphony and sacred music with Domenico Bartolucci. The Italian prelate had an extensive diplomatic career spanning over two decades. He entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See in 1973 and went on to serve as Apostolic Nuncio to several countries, including Haiti (1992-1995) during a time of conflict, social tension and violence, Paraguay (1995-1999), India and Nepal (1999-2002), and Brazil (2002-2012). Between 1986 and 1991 he served at the pontifical representation of Zimbabwe. During his time in Brazil, Baldisseri achieved a significant agreement regulating the juridical status of the Church in the country, which became a model for other religions seeking agreements with the Brazilian state. In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Baldisseri Secretary of the Congregation for Bishops and Secretary of the College of Cardinals. He served as the secretary of the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis, who, in a symbolic gesture, gave Baldisseri his own red zucchetto at the end of the conclave, indicating his intention to make him a cardinal. In September 2013, Pope Francis named Baldisseri the General Secretary of the Synod of Bishops, a position he held until September 2020. In this role, he was responsible for organizing synod operations according to the pope’s vision of radically revamping its working methods. Pope Francis elevated Baldisseri to the rank of Cardinal-Deacon on February 22, 2014, assigning him to the deaconry of Sant’Anselmo all’Aventino. He was appointed a member of the Congregation for Bishops and the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. He remains a member of the latter, according to the Vatican. On July 1, 2024, Baldisseri joined the order of cardinal-priests. In May 2014 and in the context of the first Synod on the Family, Baldisseri made headlines when he suggested in a newspaper interview that it was time to update Church doctrine concerning divorce and civil partnerships. He stated, “The Church is not timeless, she lives amidst the vicissitudes of history and the Gospel must be known and experienced by people today.” This statement was seen as controversial as it appeared to be a departure from established Church teachings. Cardinal Baldisseri was involved in several controversies surrounding the 2014 Extraordinary Synod on the Family primarily revolving around manipulation allegations. These included that he tried to predetermine the outcome of the Synod’s deliberations and documents; that under his leadership, experts recommended by institutes known for their fidelity to Catholic moral teaching were deliberately excluded while “progressive” experts were retained; and that the cardinal was involved in the controversial removal of books co-authored by five cardinals from the mailboxes of synod fathers, claiming their distribution was not “opportune.” The allegations led in part to a letter of 13 cardinals ahead of the 2015 Synod on the Family in which they expressed concerns to the Pope about the synod’s working document and that the synod procedures were leading “to a predetermined conclusion.” The cardinal strongly denied the allegations of manipulation, saying the changes were part of Pope Francis’ vision for greater participation and “synodality” in the Church. Cardinal Baldisseri speaks Italian and some English, French, Spanish and Portuguese.","• Theology/Ideology: Baldisseri advocates for a modernized approach to Church doctrine, emphasizing the need for adaptability to contemporary societal issues.

19,Philippe Barbarin,"Cardinal Philippe Xavier Christian Ignace Marie Barbarin is a former Archbishop of Lyon who was known for his innovative approach to pastoral work, commitment to interfaith dialogue, and support for persecuted Christians. His career received a serious setback in 2017 when questions arose over his handling of sexual abuse allegations in the Church — allegations which were subsequently thrown out on appeal. Born on October 17, 1950, in Rabat, Morocco, into a large family with six sisters, two of whom are nuns, and four brothers, Barbarin studied at the public Lycée Marcellin Berthelot in Saint-Maur and then in Paris at the Catholic Collège des Francs-Bourgeois, where he completed his baccalaureate. He studied philosophy at the Major Seminary of Paris, the Institute for Comparative Philosophy, and the Sorbonne, interrupted for a time by military service. In 1973 he entered the Institut Catholique de Paris, where he earned a theology bachelor. Barbarin’s ecclesiastical career began with his ordination as a priest in 1977 for the Diocese of Créteil. He held a variety of pastoral assignments in France until 1994, when he taught theology in the Archdiocese of Fianarantsoa, Madagascar. His rise through the Church hierarchy was marked by his appointment as Bishop of Moulins in 1998, followed by his elevation to Archbishop of Lyon in 2002 at the young age of 51. Barbarin’s tenure as Archbishop was characterized by his enterprising and inventive approach to pastoral work. In 2003, Pope St. John Paul II elevated Barbarin to the rank of cardinal, recognizing his growing influence within the Church. One of Barbarin’s most notable achievements was his commitment to interfaith dialogue and support for Christians in the East. In 2014, he demonstrated his dedication by traveling to Erbil, Iraq, to stand in solidarity with Christians facing persecution from ISIS. His efforts in interfaith relations were further recognized when Kamel Kabtane, Imam of the Great Mosque of Lyon, awarded him the Officer’s Insignia of the National Order of Merit in 2007. But Barbarin’s career received a serious setback in 2017 when questions arose over his handling of sexual abuse allegations within the Church. He was charged that year with failing to report sexual abuse allegedly committed by priest Bernard Preynat during Boy Scout outings between 1986 and 1991. This led to a high-profile trial in 2019, where Barbarin was initially found guilty and given a suspended six-month prison sentence. Following the verdict, Barbarin submitted his resignation to Pope Francis, who initially refused it, invoking the presumption of innocence. Barbarin’s conviction was later overturned on appeal on January 30, 2020. Despite this legal victory, Pope Francis accepted Barbarin’s resignation as Archbishop of Lyon on March 6, 2020, effectively ending his tenure in this position. In 2012, Barbarin made clear his firm opposition to same-sex “marriage” in France.1 His vocal stance on the issue, which he viewed as a significant change in civilization, earned him both supporters and critics, particularly within the government. Barbarin suffered a double heart attack on a flight from Lyon to 2013 World Youth Day in Rio de Janeiro. He was transferred to Fort de France, Martinique, where he underwent a triple bypass operation.

20,Pedro Ricardo Barreto Jimeno,"Cardinal Pedro Ricardo Barreto Jimeno, a retired former Jesuit Archbishop of Huancayo, Peru, played a key role in organizing the 2019 Amazon Synod and is known for his outspoken generally liberal views on national politics and focus on the environment. Born on February 12, 1944, in Lima, Peru, he joined the Jesuit novitiate in Lima and pursued his philosophical studies at the Jesuit faculty in Alcalá de Henares, Spain, before completing his theological studies in Lima. Barreto was ordained as a priest on December 18, 1971, and took his final vows as a Jesuit on October 3, 1976. He served in various roles, including assistant to the master of novices, head of vocational pastoral ministry, professor, spiritual director, parish priest, and superior in different communities across Peru. On November 9, 2001, he was appointed as vicar apostolic of Jaén and titular bishop of Acufida. His episcopal ordination took place on January 1, 2002. On July 17, 2004, he was appointed as Archbishop of Huancayo, a position he held until his retirement on February 12, 2024. Pope Francis elevated Barreto to cardinal in the consistory of June 28, 2018, assigning him the titular church of Santi Pietro e Paolo a Via Ostiense. He is a member of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development. Cardinal Barreto is known for his strong stance on environmental issues, echoing Pope Francis’s call to care for “our common home.” He faced death threats for speaking out against pollution from a smelter in La Oroya that threatened the health of people living in the Andes Mountains. His commitment to environmental causes led to confrontations with government officials and managers of U.S.-based Doe Run Peru, which owned the smelter complex. The Peruvian cardinal has been unafraid to speak out on political issues in his country, often resulting in considerable backlash. In May 2021, he generated controversy for statements that were interpreted as support for Pedro Castillo, then a presidential candidate accused of having links to terrorism. In December 2023, Cardinal Barreto harshly criticized the release of former President Alberto Fujimori, calling it “a slap in the face to the country.” In 2018, he defended gender ideology, stating that it “dignifies men and women,” despite the fact that the ideology has been condemned by Pope Francis. Interviewed by Ideeleradio, Barreto said: “The Church has some principles and values that cannot be renounced and speaks of dignifying the role of women in every field of action and, in that sense, we have to be aware that this gender approach, which seems to me to be the most appropriate for dignifying both men and women, each in their own role, is not going to be easy.” Barreto has held significant positions in various Church organizations. He served as the president of the bishops’ Social Action Commission in 2006 and president of the Justice and Solidarity Department of the Latin American bishops’ council (CELAM) in 2011. He is also a vice president of the Pan-Amazonian Ecclesial Network (REPAM) and was a member of the organizing committee for the Pan-Amazon Synod of Bishops. In 2019, during that Synod of Bishops, Barreto expressed support for Pope Francis’ vision of the Church, stating that those who oppose the Pope “want a static Church, a Church of doctrine, more than one of pastoral action.” He argued that what was needed was a Church that responds to the needs of people and nature itself. He also said that he believed “the majority” of the synod fathers were in favor of the ordination of viri probati (married men of proven virtue) because they were concerned to provide the Eucharist regularly to communities in the vast Amazonian region that otherwise would not have it except with great irregularity. Pope Francis did not explicitly approve or endorse the ordination of viri probati to the priesthood in his apostolic exhortation Querida Amazonia. The cardinal also criticized reducing the synod to a debate on ordaining married men as he said it distracted from “the socio-environmental problems of the Amazonian region.” Cardinal Barreto was a member of the organizing committee for the Pan-Amazon Synod, during which the Pachamama controversy occurred, but he did not appear to have any direct role in its organization. Also during the synod he was one of a number of Church leaders who took part in a renewal of the 1965 “Pact of the Catacombs” that had originally aimed to bring the Church closer to the poor and back to the early Church, but which its critics said helped pave the way for liberation theology. Cardinal Barreto speaks Spanish but it is unclear if he speaks any other languages.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Barreto advocates for a progressive interpretation of Church teachings, emphasizing environmental stewardship and social justice aligned with Pope Francis's vision.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his boldness in addressing controversial political issues, often facing backlash yet remaining steadfast in his convictions.  
• Power Base: His influence stems from his leadership roles within the Church, particularly in social action and the Pan-Amazonian Ecclesial Network, which connect him to various ecclesiastical and social movements.

The Indian cardinal has emphasized the importance of unity among Eastern Churches, especially those with roots in India. He has stated that the Eastern Churches should work together to preserve their unique traditions while maintaining communion with Rome. He has participated in various ecumenical meetings and initiatives aimed at fostering greater understanding and cooperation between the Catholic and Orthodox Churches.

22,Gualtiero Bassetti,"Cardinal Gualtiero Bassetti is a former president of Italy’s bishops’ conference who is dedicated to helping the marginalized and became the first bishop of Perugia to be named a cardinal since 1853. Born on April 7, 1942, in Popolano di Marradi near Florence, he began his religious journey by attending the minor and major seminaries of the Archdiocese of Florence, leading to his ordination as a priest on June 29, 1966. Bassetti’s early career was marked by significant roles in religious education. He served as a vicar in the parish of St. Michael in San Salvi before becoming an assistant at the minor seminary of Florence in 1968. His leadership qualities were recognized early, as he was appointed rector of the minor seminary in 1972 and later became the rector of the major seminary of Florence in 1979, a position he held for 11 years. In 2001 John Paul II appointed him national delegate for the seminaries of Italy, reconfirmed in 2006 by Benedict XVI for another five years. Bassetti’s ascent in the Church hierarchy began with his appointment as Bishop of Massa Marittima-Piombino in 1994. He continued to climb the ranks, becoming the Archbishop of Arezzo-Cortona-Sansepolcro in 1998 and later the Archbishop of Perugia-Città della Pieve in 2009. He participated in the 2000 World Youth Day at Tor Vergata near Rome, and has dedicated himself to working with the youth and families. A significant milestone in Bassetti’s career came on February 22, 2014, when Pope Francis elevated him to the rank of cardinal. This appointment was notable as it marked the first time a bishop of Perugia had been named a cardinal since Gioacchino Pecci (later Pope Leo XIII) in 1853. Bassetti’s leadership extended beyond his diocese when Pope Francis appointed him as the head of the Italian Episcopal Conference (CEI) for a five-year term on May 23, 2017. In this role, he emphasized the importance of collegiality, dialogue, and the integration of social justice with personal morality. Throughout his career, Cardinal Bassetti has been known for his pastoral approach and concern for the marginalized. He has advocated integrating migrants into Italian society and has proposed reforms to support families and promote employment. In 2016, at Pope Francis’s request, he was given the honor of writing the meditations for the Good Friday Way of the Cross service at the Colosseum. Cardinal Bassetti has made calls for a more open and transparent approach towards abuse scandals in the Church. He was reportedly resistant to Pope Francis’s desire to convene a synod of the Church in Italy, which led to some friction. Bassetti has been appointed to several important Vatican dicasteries, including for Bishops, Clergy, and Promoting Christian Unity. The cardinal nearly died of COVID in October 2020, and was placed in intensive care. Cardinal Bassetti’s tenure as Archbishop of Perugia-Città della Pieve and as president of the Italian Episcopal Conference concluded in May 2022 when Pope Francis accepted his resignation at the age of 80, marking the end of a long and influential career in the Catholic Church. It is unclear if he speaks any other languages apart from Italian.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Bassetti emphasizes the integration of social justice with personal morality, advocating for the marginalized and promoting family support.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his pastoral approach, he values dialogue and collegiality, although he has shown resistance to some of Pope Francis’s initiatives, indicating a complex negotiation style.

23,Domenico Battaglia,"Cardinal Domenico Battaglia, the Archbishop of Naples, is a straight-talking prelate known as the “Bergoglio of Southern Italy” due his work as a “street priest” helping drug addicts, the poor and the marginalized. He has also become famous for his battles against organized crime, but a recent case of alleged mafia infiltration in his archdiocese has raised questions about his governance. Battaglia has also faced protests for banning the Vetus Ordo (traditional Roman Rite) in the Neapolitan archdiocese. Born on January 20, 1963, in Satriano, Catanzaro, Italy, “Don Mimmo” as he is known studied philosophy and theology at the Pontifical Regional Seminary San Pio X in Catanzaro and was ordained priest on February 6, 1988. Battaglia’s early career was marked by his dedication to social causes. He served in various roles, including parish priest, rector of a seminary, and director of missionary association. He became especially involved in supporting efforts to recover from drug addiction. From 1992 to 2015, he held leadership positions in organizations focused on rehabilitation and therapeutic communities, including serving as the National President of the Italian Federation of Therapeutic Communities (FICT). On June 24, 2016, Pope Francis appointed Battaglia as Bishop of Cerreto Sannita-Telese-Sant’Agata de’ Goti, making him the first priest from that diocese to become a bishop since 1960. His episcopal motto, “Confide surge vocat te” (Take heart, arise, He is calling you), reflects his commitment to serving those in need. Since being installed as Archbishop of Naples on February 2, 2021, Battaglia has become known for his strong stance against organized crime, particularly the Camorra, the region’s prominent crime group. He has appealed for members of organized crime groups to “be converted” and has initiated hands-on outreach to the city’s most affected districts. He has also developed educational projects in collaboration with civil society and the private sector to combat organized crime. However, in the summer of 2024 the cardinal faced allegations that the mafia had connections with the Pontifical Theological Faculty of Southern Italy. The faculty, which is located in the archdiocese of Naples and has Cardinal Battaglia as its grand chancellor, has been accused of being infiltrated by the ‘Ndrangheta’ crime syndicate. Cardinal Battaglia held urgent meetings with curia staff but remained silent on these specific allegations. His silence is particularly noteworthy given his outspoken criticism of the mafia and his close association with Father Luigi Ciotti, a well-known social activist and founder of anti-mafia organization, Libera. The situation highlights the complex relationship between the Church and organized crime in southern Italy. While the Vatican and Church leaders like Battaglia have taken increasingly strong stances against mafia groups in recent years, the deep-rooted nature of these organizations continues to present challenges. Throughout his Church career, Battaglia has been a strong advocate for various marginalized groups. He has spoken out in support of drug addicts, victims of domestic violence, the elderly, and the unemployed. Like Francis, he likes to see the Gospel lived by helping those on the periphery of society.1 But in May 2024, Battaglia caused a furore by issuing a decree banning all celebrations in the old rite with the exception of an institute of French religious. His action led to protests and a petition calling on him to revoke the ban. Petitioners stressed that Traditionis Custodes issued restrictions, not an outright ban, on the old Mass. The dispute has not yet been resolved. Battaglia, who is liked for his straightforward and easy-going style, has also been criticized for a lack of presence in the city and difficulties faithful have experienced in being able to meet him. The Italian cardinal has written several books, including “Old Slippers… Shoes of Angels — The Tenderness of a Priest Walking With the Last” and “The Poor Are Always Right.” Pope Francis elevated Battaglia to cardinal on December 7, 2024. His appointment came as a surprise as Battaglia had not previously been included in the original list of new cardinals announced in October. His name was added after Indonesian Bishop Paskalis Bruno Syukur of Bogor declined the cardinalate. ","• Theology/Ideology: Battaglia emphasizes a pastoral approach that aligns with Pope Francis's focus on social justice and serving marginalized communities.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his straightforwardness and easy-going demeanor, Battaglia is approachable yet has faced criticism for his perceived absence from the faithful.  
• Power Base: His strong advocacy against organized crime and outreach to the marginalized in Naples positions him as a leader with grassroots support, albeit challenged by recent allegations of mafia infiltration.  
• Core Motivation: Driven by a commitment to uplift the marginalized, Battaglia seeks to embody the Gospel through direct action and social advocacy in his ministry.","Cardinal Domenico Battaglia is recognized for his pastoral approach that resonates with the social justice priorities of Pope Francis, particularly through his advocacy for marginalized communities and his efforts against organized crime in Naples.

24,Giovanni Angelo Becciu,"Cardinal Giovanni Angelo Becciu is an Italian prelate and former deputy secretary of state at the Vatican who in 2023 was sentenced to several years in prison on embezzlement charges pending the results of an appeal. He is not eligible to take part in the next papal conclave. Born on June 2, 1948 in Pattada, Sardinia, Becciu completed his studies in theology and philosophy and was then ordained to the priesthood on 27 August 1972. He attended the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, where he earned a doctoral degree in canon law. He entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See in 1984, serving in various missions around the world including the Central African Republic, New Zealand, Liberia, the United Kingdom, France and the United States. In 2001, Pope John Paul II appointed Becciu as Apostolic Nuncio to Angola and São Tomé and Príncipe. He later served as Nuncio to Cuba from 2009 to 2011. In 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as Substitute for General Affairs in the Secretariat of State, making him the third most powerful official in the Vatican. Pope Francis made Becciu a cardinal in 2018 and appointed him as Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. However, in September 2020, Pope Francis accepted Becciu’s resignation from his position and rights as a cardinal amid a financial scandal. In July 2021, Becciu became the first cardinal to be tried by the Vatican’s criminal court, facing charges of embezzlement, abuse of office, and witness tampering related to a controversial London real estate deal and other financial matters, one involving a charity his brother ran in Sardinia. Throughout the trial, Becciu maintained his innocence. On December 16, 2023, Becciu was convicted of several counts of embezzlement and sentenced to 5 years and 6 months in prison, fined 8,000 euros, and permanently disqualified from holding public office. Cardinal Becciu was also named in a €9.3 million lawsuit against the Vatican by the Vatican’s former auditor general and his deputy in 2022. 1 Allegations persist around his role in sending large sums of money to Australia around the time of Cardinal Pell’s trial in Australia which some believe might have been used to negatively influence the outcome of the court hearings. Becciu has denied the allegations. Becciu is not eligible to take part in the next papal conclave because in 2020 he resigned from the rights associated with the cardinalate, including the right to participate in a papal conclave. The Italian cardinal is therefore listed by the Vatican as a “non-elector” despite being of voting age (under 80 years old), and although Pope Francis invited Becciu to attend a consistory in August 2022, this invitation was described as a “private act of pastoral mercy” and not a step towards his rehabilitation or reinstatement of his cardinalatial rights. Given these factors, particularly his resignation of cardinalatial rights and his continued status as a non-elector, Cardinal Becciu is not eligible to participate in the next papal conclave unless Pope Francis explicitly reinstates his rights as a cardinal, which has not occurred at the time of writing.","• Theology/Ideology: Becciu's background in theology and canon law reflects a commitment to traditional Catholic teachings and the governance of the Church.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his diplomatic skills, Becciu has successfully navigated complex international relations throughout his career.  
• Power Base: His previous roles, including Apostolic Nuncio and Substitute for General Affairs, positioned him among the Vatican's highest-ranking officials, granting him significant influence.

25,Giuseppe Bertello,"Cardinal Giuseppe Bertello is a former Italian head of Vatican City State who had a distinguished career in Holy see diplomacy but became widely known at the end of his career for implementing some of the world’s most stringent anti-Covid protocols. Born on October 1, 1942, in Foglizzo near Turin, he earned a license in pastoral theology and a doctorate in canon law before attending the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy where he studied diplomacy. He was ordained as a priest on June 29, 1966, and holds a license in pastoral theology and a doctorate in canon law. Bertello entered the Holy See’s diplomatic service in 1971, serving initially in Sudan until 1973. His diplomatic career saw significant growth when Pope John Paul II appointed him as Titular Archbishop of Urbs Salvia and Apostolic Nuncio to Ghana, Togo, and Benin in 1987. He was later transferred to Rwanda in 1990, where he played a crucial role during a tumultuous period in the country’s history. While there, he supported human rights organizations and encouraged Catholic bishops to unite as forceful advocates for ending civil war. He remained at his post and traveled into dangerous regions to bear witness to the Tutsi Genocide in 1994. Bertello’s diplomatic acumen led to his appointment as the Holy See’s Permanent Observer to the United Nations in Geneva in 1997. In this role, he successfully negotiated the Holy See’s status as a permanent observer in the World Trade Organization, becoming its first representative that year. His career continued to flourish with appointments as Apostolic Nuncio to Mexico in 2000 and later to Italy and San Marino in 2006. These positions allowed him to further strengthen the Vatican’s diplomatic ties and influence in these regions. In 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Bertello as President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State and President of the Governorate of Vatican City State. This marked his transition from diplomatic service to a key leadership role within the Vatican itself. In recognition of his service, he was created Cardinal-Deacon of Santi Vito, Modesto e Crescenzia in 2012. Throughout his career, Bertello has received several prestigious honors. In 2007, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Mexican Order of the Aztec Eagle, and in 2008, he received the Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. Cardinal Bertello was among the cardinal electors to elect Pope Francis in the 2013 conclave. Subsequently, Pope Francis appointed him to his Council of Cardinal Advisers, otherwise known as the C9, a select group tasked with advising on Church governance and the restructuring of the Roman Curia. During the Covid crisis, Cardinal Bertello was instrumental in imposing on Vatican City State some of the most stringent protocols in the world at the express instruction of Pope Francis. These included the need for a “Green Pass” showing any entrant had received vaccination, and issuing a decree threatening employees with dismissal if they refused to receive a COVID-19 vaccination without legitimate health reasons. Bertello later was forced to walk back what became known as the “no jab, no job” instruction. It is unclear what languages the cardinal speaks apart from his native Italian, but most likely English, French and Spanish given his time as nuncio.","• Theology/Ideology: Bertello's background in pastoral theology and canon law underscores a commitment to both doctrinal fidelity and practical governance within the Church.

26,Tarcisio Bertone,"Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone, who served as secretary of state during Benedict XVI’s pontificate, is a retired Salesian canonist whose service to the Church spanned several decades but who became mired in controversy towards the end of his ecclesiastical career. Born on December 2, 1934, in Romano Canavese, Italy, was ordained as a Salesian priest in 1960, and began his journey in the Church as a professor of moral theology and canon law at the Pontifical Salesian University in Rome from 1967 to 1991. Bertone’s expertise in canon law led to his involvement in the 1983 revision of the Code of Canon Law. He also served as a consultant to various Church bodies, including the then Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. His ecclesiastical career progressed rapidly, with appointments as Archbishop of Vercelli (1991-1995) and later Archbishop of Genoa (2002-2006). In 2003, Pope John Paul II elevated Bertone to the rank of cardinal. His most significant appointment came in 2006 when Pope Benedict XVI named him Vatican Secretary of State, effectively making him the second highest-ranking official in the Church hierarchy. His choice was unusual and somewhat contentious as normally the position is held by a seasoned Vatican diplomat. Bertone had no experience in that area. In 2007, he was appointed Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, overseeing Church finances and property. Bertone’s tenure as secretary of state was marked by several controversies and challenges. In 2006, he had to address the diplomatic backlash against Pope Benedict XVI’s comments about Islam, which were perceived as critical of the prophet Muhammad. He also defended the Church against accusations of proselytizing in Russia and former Soviet republics. In 2007, Bertone staunchly defended Pope Pius XII against claims of appeasing Adolf Hitler and failing to intervene on behalf of Jews during the Holocaust. He also criticized media coverage of the Church’s sexual abuse scandal, claiming it was disproportionately negative and biased. In 2010, he made statements that were interpreted as linking pedophilia and male homosexuality, drawing criticism but also widespread support. Bertone’s management of the Roman Curia and the Vatican bank came under scrutiny due to security and financial scandals. The most notable incident was the “Vatileaks” scandal in 2012, involving the theft of confidential Vatican documents by Pope Benedict’s butler. In 2014, Bertone faced allegations of using funds from a children’s hospital to refurbish his apartment. While he was not charged or under investigation, the trial of two former hospital officials threatened to reveal embarrassing details about the deal. Bertone maintained his innocence and made a donation to the hospital, though the circumstances remained contentious. In 2018, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò claimed that as a Vatican official in 2006, he had sent Cardinal Bertone an “Indictment Memorandum” detailing alleged abuse by Theodore McCarrick but the memo “was never returned to me with any actual decisions by the superiors on this matter.” He also accused Bertone of ignoring a second memorandum warning about McCarrick in 2008. Cardinal Bertone retired as Secretary of State in October 2013 and stepped down as Camerlengo in 2014 at the age of 80. His tenure remains one of the most controversial in modern Vatican history, marked by numerous scandals and intrigues that affected the Church’s reputation and operations. Many of them were beyond his control but his handling of some of them drew criticism. The cardinal participated in the conclave of April 2005, which elected Pope Benedict XVI and in the conclave of March 2013, which elected Pope Francis.

Born on August 17, 1961, in Niangon-Adjamé, in the diocese of Yopougon, Côte d’Ivoire, Dogbo was ordained as a priest on August 2, 1987. After his ordination, Dogbo served in various parishes from 1987 to 1989. He then pursued higher education, earning a degree in exegesis from the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome. This academic achievement would later prove valuable in his teaching and leadership roles within the Church. Dogbo went on to serve as the diocesan director of the Pontifical Mission Societies from 1993 to 1995, taught biblical languages at the Saint Paul major seminary in Abadjin Kouté from 1993 to 1997, and served as vicar general of Yopougon from 1995 to 2004. On March 19, 2004, he was appointed Bishop of Katiola, receiving his episcopal consecration on July 4 of the same year. His leadership abilities were further recognized when he was appointed as the Apostolic Administrator of Korhogo in 2017, followed by his elevation to Archbishop of Korhogo on January 3, 2021. The pinnacle of his career came on May 20, 2024, when Pope Francis appointed him as the Archbishop of Abidjan, succeeding Cardinal Jean Pierre Kutwa. Cardinal Dogbo has held several significant leadership positions within the Catholic Church in Côte d’Ivoire. He served as the president of the Episcopal Conference of Côte d’Ivoire (CECCI) from 2017 to 2023, demonstrating his ability to guide the national Church. He took part in the Vatican Synod on the Family in October 2015, where he represented the Ivorian bishops. He went on later to attend as a delegate the Synod on Synodality in Rome in 2024. Pope Francis elevated Cardinal Dogbo to the College of Cardinals on December 7, 2024, reflecting Francis’ efforts to increase diversity within the College and to give greater representation to the global South in the Church’s leadership. Dogbo is renowned for his commitment to peace and reconciliation, playing a crucial role in West African peace processes, particularly in the aftermath of political conflicts. He has emphasized the importance of open dialogue about the post-election conflict of 2011 and the ongoing reconciliation process, stating that this is the only route through which peace and social cohesion can be achieved. Cardinal Dogbo has worked to promote peaceful coexistence between different faiths in Côte d’Ivoire. He has highlighted the importance of interfaith dialogue and cooperation, noting that Christians and Muslims in the country are managing to coexist largely without tension. The archbishop has also stressed the common brotherhood of all Ivorians, regardless of their religious background. Under Dogbo’s leadership, the Ivorian Bishops’ Conference has developed a new pastoral plan for 2019-2023, which includes concrete steps to promote reconciliation.1 Dogbo has praised efforts by political leaders to foster reconciliation. For instance, he commended President Alassane Ouattara’s decision to pardon former President Laurent Gbagbo, calling it a significant gesture. However, he also emphasized the need to go further and include all Ivorians in the reconciliation process, urging that “everyone participate in the country’s political life.” The cardinal has also addressed some of the underlying issues that contribute to social unrest. He has called for fair trade policies and better economic opportunities for young people as a means of preventing emigration and potential conflicts. Like many of his African confreres, Dogbo has taken a traditional Catholic stance on “LGBTQ” issues. In 2023, as his term as president of the Episcopal Conference of Côte d’Ivoire concluded, he preached that “Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender populations need to be healed, not presented as a canon of behavior to be embodied.” The cardinal has shown a commitment to fostering synodality within the Church. During his installation as Archbishop of Abidjan in August 2024, he pledged to promote the theme of the Synod on Synodality: communion, participation, and mission. He emphasized the importance of maintaining “unfailing synodality” and announced his intention to begin his ministry with a series of consultations, stating, “We’ll have to start with conversations in the Spirit.”","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Dogbo emphasizes peace, reconciliation, and interfaith dialogue, advocating for a cohesive society in Côte d’Ivoire amidst religious diversity.

28,Giuseppe Betori,"Cardinal Giuseppe Betori is a recently retired Archbishop of Florence with generally conservative views who survived an assassination attempt in 2011 but was criticized for selling Church land to Muslims in 2017. Born on February 25, 1947, in Foligno, Italy, Betori was ordained a priest in 1970. He pursued higher education, earning a licentiate in theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University and a doctorate in Sacred Scripture from the Pontifical Biblical Institute. Throughout his career, Betori held several significant positions within the Catholic Church. He served as a professor of Sacred Scripture and Dean of the Theological Institute of Assisi, as well as director of the Catechistic Office of the Italian Episcopal Conference (CEI). In 2001, Pope John Paul II appointed him Secretary General of the CEI and appointed him bishop. In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI elevated Betori to cardinal and he participated in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis. Betori also served in several Vatican departments, including the Pontifical Council for Culture, the Congregation for Catholic Education, and the Pontifical Council of the Laity. He remains a member of the Dicasteries for Clergy and for the Causes of Saints. In 2005 Betori supported a Vatican document that banned the ordination of men who were “actively homosexual” and had “deep-seated homosexual tendencies,” stating that he believed a priestly vocation is a “gift” rather than a “right.” In 2011, Betori survived an apparent assassination attempt when an unidentified man confronted him outside his office, shot and wounded his secretary, and waved a gun at Betori before fleeing. The motives behind the incident remain unclear. As cardinal archbishop, in 2017 he sold Church land in Sesto Fiorentino near Florence to Muslims to build a mosque. Betori saw it positively, saying “everyone has the right to a dignified place to profess their faith” and stressed the action promoted freedom of worship. The decision drew criticism with the Jesuit expert on Islam, Father Samir Khalil Samir, calling it “madness.” In 2024, shortly before the end of his term as archbishop, Cardinal Betori gave a homily in which he harshly criticized the city of Florence, denouncing what he called “an ill-advised desire for vice” that, according to him, was permeating the city “from the squares to the places of culture.” He highlighted several social problems that afflicted Florence, including drug use, gambling, growing poverty and the situation in the city’s prisons. The cardinal described Florence as a city “sick” with vice, prompting mixed reactions.","• Theology/Ideology: Betori holds generally conservative views, emphasizing the traditional teachings of the Catholic Church while advocating for freedom of worship.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is a resilient leader, having survived an assassination attempt, which may enhance his appeal as a strong candidate.  
• Power Base: His extensive experience in various Vatican departments and leadership roles within the Italian Episcopal Conference bolsters his influence among church officials.

29,Ricardo Blázquez Pérez,"Cardinal Ricardo Blázquez Pérez is a Spanish prelate perhaps best known for his efforts to help resolve the Basque separatist conflict, his progressive theological writings, and for his commitment to addressing social issues. Born on April 13, 1942, in Villanueva del Campillo, Ávila, Spain, Blázquez Pérez pursued his early education at the seminaries of Ávila and later obtained a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. Ordained priest on February 18, 1967, he began his ecclesiastical career as secretary of the Theological Institute of Ávila. He subsequently served as a professor and dean at the Pontifical University of Salamanca, where he became Grand Chancellor between 2000 and 2004. Blázquez Pérez was appointed auxiliary bishop of Santiago de Compostela in 1988 and received episcopal consecration that same year. He later served as bishop of Palencia (1992–1995) and Bilbao (1995–2010). His tenure in Bilbao was marked by his outspoken condemnation of ETA terrorism and his efforts to promote reconciliation in Spain’s politically volatile Basque region. He courageously denounced ETA’s terrorist activities, calling their continued existence “unbearable” and stating that they “represent no one.” At the same time, he attempted to mediate peace. In 2010, he became the Archbishop of Valladolid, a position he held until retiring from episcopal office in June 2022. On arrival in Valladolid, one of his first actions was to set aside part of his salary to help those affected by an economic crisis affecting Spain at that time. He encouraged other priests to do the same. Cardinal Blázquez Pérez has been deeply involved in the Spanish Episcopal Conference. He served as its president from 2005 to 2008 and again from 2014 to 2017, with a term as vice president in between. He also participated in significant Vatican-led initiatives, including a 2009 investigation into the Legionaries of Christ and their lay movement, Regnum Christi. Known for his theological scholarship, he has authored numerous books and articles on theology and contributed to key documents for the Spanish Episcopal Conference. Liberal commentators have described him as “a theological moderate and perennial counterweight to Spain’s more doctrinally conservative and socially combative prelates.” Pope Francis elevated Blázquez Pérez to the College of Cardinals on February 14, 2015, assigning him the titular church of Santa Maria in Vallicella. He was only the third Archbishop of Vallodolid to become a cardinal since the See was established in the 16th century, and the first since 1919.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Blázquez Pérez is known for his progressive theological writings and advocacy for social justice, reflecting a commitment to modernizing the Church's approach to contemporary issues.

30,Charles Maung Bo,"Born in 1948, the year Myanmar became independent, Cardinal Charles Maung Bo was raised in a devout Catholic family of ten children. He comes from a humble and relatively poor background, and grew up in a village that he described as “very religious, with special love and respect for what was sacred and holy” and with a “God-minded orientation.”1 Baptized with the name Charles (St. Charles Borromeo is his patron saint), his father was a farmer who died when Charles was just two years old, and five of his siblings died while very young. It was his mother who nurtured his faith, sharing stories of the saints each night at bedtime, and that inspired his vocation to the priesthood. His local parish priest, Don Luwi, who taught him catechism between the ages of five and seven years old, was another source of inspiration.2 At the age of eight, Charles was taken in by a Salesian boarding house in Mandalay and educated at the Salesian-run Lafon Memorial School, and he drew inspiration from the rector, Father Giacomin Fortunato, who taught him philosophy and theology and became his novice master. Encouraged by Italian missionaries from the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions and French priests from the Society of Foreign Missions of Paris, Charles decided he wanted to be a missionary and a parish priest.3 As a Catholic in a predominantly Buddhist country, he has always had a deep exposure to other ethnic and religious groups.4 Bo began his studies in 1962 – the year General Ne Win seized power in a coup which led to decades of military dictatorship in Myanmar – enrolling at the Nazareth Aspirantate, a Salesian seminary in Anisakan village, near Pyin Oo Lwin (formally known as Maymyo). He was ordained a Salesian priest on 9 April 1976. For most of his priesthood until his appointment as Archbishop of Yangon in 2003, he served mainly in Myanmar’s ethnic states. Upon ordination, he was appointed as Parish Priest in Loihkam, near Lashio, northern Shan State, a region which was a base for ethnic armed resistance organizations such as the Kachin Independence Army (KIA) who were fighting a civil war with the Myanmar military. He served in Loihkam until 1981, and learned the local Kachin dialect, Maru, well enough to preach homilies in the language. In 1981 he was transferred to Lashio, where he served as Parish Priest until 1983, and then as Formator at Anisakan from 1983-1985. In 1985 – less than a decade after his ordination as a priest – Charles Bo was appointed Apostolic Administrator in Lashio for a year, and then as Apostolic Prefect from 1986 to 1990. When the prefecture became the diocese of Lashio in 1990, he became its first bishop, and was consecrated on 16 December 1990. That same year, he founded a new religious order, the Congregation of St Paul’s Brothers and Sisters, with “one vision of sharing the Good News of Jesus Christ with those who have not heard of him.”5 Today the congregation has over 100 sisters and about 30 brothers and priests working in six dioceses in some of the most remote areas of the country. After six years as bishop of Lashio, Pope St John Paul II appointed Bishop Bo as bishop of Pathein on 13 March 1996, making him the first bishop in Myanmar to be translated from one diocese to another. He served in Pathein until he was nominated Archbishop of Yangon, Myanmar’s then capital and largest city, on 24 May 2003, where he has served ever since. He also served as president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Myanmar from 2000 to 2006, and again since 2020 until today, and as President of the Federation of Asian Bishops’ Conferences from 2018 until 2024. Since 2020, while still fulfilling his responsibilities as Cardinal Archbishop of Yangon, Cardinal Bo became Apostolic Administrator of the diocese of Myitkyina, in Myanmar’s northern Kachin state. At the consistory of 14 February 2015, Pope Francis created and proclaimed Archbishop Bo as Myanmar’s first ever Cardinal, with the titular church in Rome of Sant’Ireneo a Centocelle (St. Irenaeus at Centocelle). Since then he has played a prominent role in the Church, representing the Pope and his country’s Church in a variety of positions and being appointed member of several Vatican dicasteries.6 His homilies, that can weave together hope, faith, peace, reconciliation and prophetic challenge, is typical of Cardinal Bo and provides an insight into his spirituality and character. He combines a rare mix of courage and wisdom, tradition and creativity, humility and humour, a steadfast faith and an openness to new ideas. Generous-spirited, pastoral and compassionate, he loves the arts, and – like Pope St. John Paul II – is himself a playwright. He also loves sport, and still plays football and basketball with priests and religious. He speaks several languages – Burmese and English primarily, but is also proficient in several of Myanmar’s ethnic languages as well as Italian. And as a Salesian, he has a particular devotion to the youth.7        Regarded by some as “solidly orthodox”, Cardinal Bo was deeply inspired by and loyal to Pope Benedict XVI and has developed a similar loyalty and close relationship with Pope Francis. In particular, he supports synodality, Francis’ emphasis on mercy, and his focus on environmental issues and climate change. He has strongly criticized the Chinese Communist Party but stopped short of criticizing the Pope for his accord with Beijing on the appointment of bishops. Bo has been criticized at times for being too diplomatic and seeming to compromise on some issues.8 Those who know Bo well say he is not in favor of ordaining women priests, making priestly celibacy optional, and blessings of same-sex couples. But he has spoken little, if at all, about these issues as they are not generally issues for the Church in Myanmar, and because he prefers to focus on justice and peace in such a conflict-ridden and repressed nation — all issues that are priorities for his public statements. As one of the most senior and high-profile cardinals in Asia, Cardinal Bo has gained considerable worldwide respect for his leadership of the Church in Myanmar, throughout decades of conflict and repression as well as during a decade – from 2011 until the coup in 2021 – of limited opening and reform. Bo is seen as an inspirational leader, loyal to both the Church and the Pope while being willing to courageously speak out against injustice as well as listen to others. He also has focused on youth as well as peace, reconciliation and inter-religious dialogue. Together with his experience leading the Federation of Asian Bishops Conferences, some consider him a strong candidate if the cardinals were to choose a pontiff from Asia.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Charles Maung Bo is known for his solidly orthodox beliefs, loyalty to the papacy, and emphasis on justice, peace, and inter-religious dialogue.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is recognized for his blend of courage, wisdom, humility, and humor, which aids in his diplomatic approach to addressing complex issues.

33,Josip Bozanić,"Cardinal Josip Bozanić is a former long-serving Archbishop of Zagreb who held several leadership positions in the Church and had a prominent role in a successful Croatian referendum that sought to create a constitutional prohibition against same-sex “marriage.” Born on March 20, 1949, in Rijeka, Croatia, he was ordained as a priest on June 29, 1975, and holds licentiates in both dogmatic theology and canon law. Bozanić began his ecclesiastical journey as a parish priest for three years before pursuing further studies in Rome from 1979 to 1985. Upon returning to Yugoslavia, he served in various roles, including chancellor and vicar general of the Curia of Krk, and as a lecturer of dogmatic theology and canon law at the Theological Institute of Rijeka. On May 10, 1989, at the age of 40, Bozanić was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Krk, making him one of the youngest bishops in Europe at the time. He became the Bishop of Krk on November 14, 1989. His career continued to advance, and on July 5, 1997, he was nominated Archbishop of Zagreb, a position he held until April 15, 2023, when Pope Francis accepted his resignation. Bozanić was created a cardinal by Pope John Paul II in the consistory of October 21, 2003. As a cardinal, he has been a member of several important Vatican bodies, including the Dicasteries for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, and for Evangelization. Throughout his career, Bozanić has held several leadership positions within the Church. He served as President of the Bishops’ Conference of Croatia from 1997 to 2007. He was also the Vice-President of the Council of European Bishops’ Conferences from 2001 to 2011. Currently, he serves as an observer for Croatia at the ComECE (Commission of the Bishops’ Conferences of the European Community). In 2014, Cardinal Bozanic was appointed to the cardinal commission for the Vatican bank, officially known as the Institute for Works of Religion (IOR). The cardinal commission has played a crucial role in overseeing the operations and governance of the Vatican bank and Bozanic’s appointment was seen as part of a broader framework of economic and communications reforms announced by the Holy See. The cardinal took part in the 2005 conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI and the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis. In 2013, Bozanić was involved in a Croatian referendum on the definition of marriage. The question was: “Are you in favor of the constitution of the Republic of Croatia being amended with a provision stating that marriage is matrimony between a woman and a man?”. Its aim was to create a constitutional prohibition against same-sex “marriage.” The cardinal issued a pastoral letter to be read in all Catholic churches across the country, reminding parishioners that “marriage is the only union enabling procreation.” The referendum, which was opposed by the country’s president and prime minister, passed with 66% approval and was seen as a significant victory for the Church. In 2017, Cardinal Josip Bozanić used the pulpit to criticize those who had obstructed the canonization process of Blessed Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, who was persecuted by the Communists. He stressed that his canonization process wasn’t solely a matter of the Catholic Church but had been a political question from its beginning. Speaking on behalf of the Croatian bishops’ conference in 2020, the cardinal praised synodality as a “prophetic act of the Church attentive to the signs of the times” and as a means towards peace in the contemporary world. “What we are witnessing at present seems to be a return to processes that we believed to be past,” he said. “The world balance, through this conflict, seems to be moving in the direction of the reconstitution of opposing blocks.” But he said the Church is an instrument of peace because she has “always acted and urged that relationships of interdependence be transformed into relationships of mutual dialogue and solidarity, as dimensions that are the soul of human development.” Pope Francis accepted Bozanić’s resignation as archbishop of Zagreb on April 15, 2023 when the cardinal was only 74, a year earlier than required. The cardinal had been suffering from ill health and had almost completely withdrawn from appearing in public although he had begun to recover. He was immediately succeeded by his coadjutor, Archbishop Dražen Kutleša. During his long tenure as archbishop of Zagreb, priestly vocations fell slightly from 646 in 1999 to 556 in 2023. Numbers of male and female religious also respectively dropped over the same period, from 421 to 367 (with a rise to 518 in 2010) and from 1,503 to 854.

This appointment was seen as recognition of Brady’s positive contribution to the Northern Ireland peace process. Martin McGuinness, a former IRA commander who later led Northern Ireland’s governing assembly with Rev. Ian Paisley, attended Brady’s elevation to cardinal and praised Brady.  He said Brady was “a great supporter of the peace process and of the need to implement the Good Friday Agreement over the course of many years.” Brady, he added, had “worked with others within other churches to bring about further peace and reconciliation among all people.” The Irish cardinal played a significant role in organizing Pope John Paul II’s historic visit to Ireland in 1979. As Archbishop of Armagh, Brady was elected President of the Irish Episcopal Conference, demonstrating his leadership within the Irish Catholic Church. In 1975, then Father Brady was involved in an internal Church inquiry into allegations of child abuse against priest Brendan Smyth. Brady, then a teacher, had the role of notary or note-taker during the enquiry. The process required all participants to maintain confidentiality. The children involved, including the victim, were made to sign vows of silence regarding the allegations. Crucially, the information, including a list Brady received of other potential victims, was not reported to civil authorities. Smyth continued to abuse children for many years after the enquiry. This incident came to light in 2010, leading to calls for Brady’s resignation. Brady maintained that he fulfilled his duty as a notary and lacked the authority to stop Smyth. He expressed regret for being part of a culture of “deference and silence” but also stated that a BBC program on the scandal had “exaggerated and misrepresented” his role. He has spoken out against same-sex unions and abortion in Ireland. Cardinal Seán Brady retired from his position as Archbishop of Armagh on 8 September 2014, when Pope Francis accepted his resignation. Throughout his career, he has been a significant figure in the Irish Catholic Church, contributing to both ecclesiastical affairs and broader social issues, while also facing challenges related to the Church’s handling of abuse cases.","• Theology/Ideology: Brady has consistently upheld traditional Catholic teachings, particularly opposing same-sex unions and abortion in Ireland.

35,Walter Brandmüller,"Cardinal Walter Brandmüller is a highly distinguished Church historian and prolific author who has been critical of aspects of Pope Francis’ pontificate and Benedict XVI’s resignation. Born on January 5, 1929, in Ansbach, Germany, Walter Brandmüller was baptized and raised Catholic; his father, who was an army officer, was Catholic and his mother Lutheran.  Brandmüller pursued his higher education at Ludwig-Maximilians University in Munich, where he earned a doctorate in history in 1962. His doctoral thesis focused on the reestablishment of Catholic parishes in the principalities of Ansbach and Bayreuth. In 1967, he further solidified his academic credentials by obtaining his habilitation with a dissertation on the Council of Pavia-Siena. Ordained priest on July 26, 1953, in Bamberg by Archbishop Joseph Otto Kolb, Brandmüller began his pastoral work in various parishes. His academic career flourished alongside his religious duties, as he served as a professor of Church History and Patrology at the Philosophisch-Theologische Hochschule Dillingen from 1969 to 1971. He then moved to the University of Augsburg, where he held the position of Professor of Modern and Medieval Church History until his retirement in 1997. Brandmüller’s contributions to the field of Church history are significant. He founded and edited the journal Annuarium Historiae Conciliorum and initiated the Konziliengeschichte series, which has published 37 volumes to date. He has published well over 100 works and his expertise in council history led to his appointment as a member of the Pontifical Committee for Historical Sciences from 1981 to 1998. He was appointed the committee’s president from 1998 to 2009.1 From 2001 to 2009, Cardinal Brandmüller served two terms as president of the International Commission for Comparative Ecclesiastical History. In recognition of his work, the cardinal has received several prestigious awards: the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany; the Austrian Cross Litteris et Artibus; the Czech František Palacký Honorary Medal for Merit in the Historical Sciences; and the Grand Cross of the Holy Sepulcher. On November 20, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI elevated Brandmüller to the College of Cardinals, assigning him the title of Cardinal-Deacon of S. Giuliano dei Fiamminghi. In May 2021, after a decade as cardinal deacon, he was confirmed by Pope Francis in his transition to the rank of cardinal priest. Cardinal Brandmüller has criticized the state of the contemporary Church while also proposing solutions. In 2016, he was one of four cardinals who submitted five questions (dubia) to Pope Francis seeking clarification on doctrinal points related to the Pope’s apostolic exhortation Amoris Laetitia. When they received no response, the cardinals made their letter public, causing significant debate within the Church. In February 2019, Brandmüller, along with Cardinal Raymond Burke, penned an open letter to the presidents of episcopal conferences calling for an end to what they termed “the plague of the homosexual agenda” within the Church. They said this agenda was responsible for the sexual abuse crisis and was spread by “organized networks” protected by a “conspiracy of silence.” The letter was released ahead of a key global summit on clerical sex abuse at the Vatican. In 2018, correspondence between Cardinal Brandmüller and Benedict XVI was published — without the cardinal’s consent — showing Brandmüller’s opposition to Benedict’s 2013 resignation. Although he had been a lifelong supporter of Joseph Ratzinger, he was critical of his resignation as pope, partly because Benedict did not consult his cardinals who are meant to be his advisers. More recently, in August 2023, Brandmüller was among five cardinals who submitted another list of questions to Pope Francis, seeking clarity ahead of the Synod on Synodality. They requested clarity on topics relating to doctrinal development, the blessing of same-sex unions, the authority of the Synod on Synodality, women’s ordination, and sacramental absolution. The cardinals found the responses unsatisfactory.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Brandmüller is a staunch defender of traditional Catholic doctrine and has publicly criticized modern interpretations of Church teachings.

36,Leopoldo José Brenes Solórzano,"Cardinal Leopoldo José Brenes Solórzano is a Nicaraguan prelate who has been at the center of efforts to mediate conflicts and promote peace in Nicaragua in the face of clashes between the Church and state. Born in Ticuantepe, in the archdiocese of Managua, on March 7, 1949, he began his religious journey at a young age, entering the seminary at 16 after attending Catholic primary and secondary schools. He completed his studies in philosophy and theology at the national seminary in Managua and in the council seminary of the archdiocese of México. He then earned his baccalaureate in theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University and licentiate in dogmatic theology at the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome. His ecclesiastical career has been marked by steady progression and significant appointments within the Church hierarchy. Brenes Solórzano was ordained as an auxiliary bishop in Managua in 1988, serving in this role until 1991. He then became the Bishop of Matagalpa from 1991 to 2005, before being appointed as the Archbishop of Managua in 2005, a position he continues to hold. His leadership and dedication to the Church were further recognized when Pope Francis elevated him to the rank of Cardinal in 2014. Throughout his career, Cardinal Brenes has taken on several important leadership roles within the Nicaraguan Catholic Church. He served as the president of the Episcopal Conference of Nicaragua from 2005 to 2011 and was re-elected to this position in November 2014. This role has allowed him to guide the Church’s response to various national issues and represent the Nicaraguan Catholic community on both national and international stages. Cardinal Brenes has been at the forefront of the Church’s efforts during challenging times in Nicaragua. In recent years, he has faced significant challenges due to the sociopolitical crisis in the country. In 2024, he ordained nine new priests amidst one of the worst waves of persecution against the Catholic Church in Nicaragua. This act demonstrated his commitment to the Church’s mission despite difficult circumstances. The Latin American cardinal has also been involved in efforts to mediate conflicts and promote peace in Nicaragua. In 2018, he was part of a group of bishops who attempted to free protesters who had taken refuge in a church, highlighting his role in addressing the country’s political tensions. The relationship between the Catholic Church and the Nicaraguan government has been strained in recent years, with Cardinal Brenes often finding himself at the center of these tensions. In May 2023, the Nicaraguan National Police accused the Catholic Church of various crimes, including money laundering, putting Church leaders like Cardinal Brenes in a difficult position. Despite these challenges, Cardinal Brenes has continued to advocate for justice and peace. He has encouraged the faithful to pray for peace in Nicaragua and has called for dialogue with victims of the sociopolitical crisis. His leadership during these turbulent times has been crucial for the Catholic community in Nicaragua. During his tenure as archbishop of Managua, priestly vocations have risen from 158 just before he took office to 253 in 2021. Male religious have risen slightly, from 107 to 113, but female religious vocations have sharply declined from 565 to 270. Apart from his native Spanish, it is unclear if he speaks any other languages.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Brenes emphasizes peace and dialogue, reflecting a commitment to social justice and reconciliation within the Church's mission in Nicaragua.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his diplomatic skills, he has effectively mediated conflicts between the Church and state, often advocating for the marginalized.

37,Stephen Brislin,"Cardinal Stephen Brislin, the Archbishop of Johannesburg, is a heterodox-leaning prelate of Scottish and Irish descent who is committed to social issues and has risen to prominence in recent years on account of his leadership abilities. Born in Welkom on 24 September 1956, he received his early education at the Convent of Saint Agnes and Christian Brothers schools in Welkom. Brislin went on to pursue higher education at various institutions, studying psychology at the University of Cape Town, philosophy at St. John Vianney Seminary in Pretoria, and theology at the progressive and now closed Missionary Institute of Mill Hill in London. Ordained as a priest on November 19, 1983, after completing his studies at the University of Louvain1, Brislin’s ecclesiastical career has been marked by steady progression and significant appointments. Pope Benedict XVI appointed him Bishop of Kroonstad on January 28, 2007. His leadership abilities were further recognized when Benedict named him Archbishop of Cape Town on December 18, 2009, a position he assumed on February 7, 2010. Brislin’s influence extended beyond his archdiocese when he served as the president of the Southern African Catholic Bishops’ Conference from 2013 to 2019. During this time, he participated in important Church events, including the 2014 and 2015 Synods on the Family. Pope Francis elevated Brislin to the rank of cardinal in 2023, assigning him the title of Cardinal Priest of Santa Maria Domenica Mazzarello. He was appointed Archbishop of Johannesburg on October 28, 2024 and installed on January 25, 2025. Cardinal Brislin was elected President of the Southern African Catholic Bishops’ Conference on August 7, 2024. Throughout his ministry, Brislin has shown himself to be on the classically liberal wing of the Church, committed to social issues. He takes a welcoming view of those groups who suffer from homosexual tendencies and, after some years banning them, allowed a dissident group that advocates women priests and married clergy to be allowed in the archdiocese. Under Brislin’s watch, in 2022 the archdiocese published a synthesis report as part of its contribution to the Synod on Synodality which called for a change in the hierarchical structure of the Church; exploration “at the very least” of a woman’s diaconate; expansion of the definition of the family, a revisiting of Humanae Vitae, and LGBTQ+ inclusion.  The report, which carried the stamp of the cardinal’s episcopal coat of arms, also took a distinctly heterodox and even revolutionary approach to tradition.  “In the world of the twenty-first century today, it is important to hold onto the tradition, know its origins, but also to embrace change,” the report stated, adding: “The strong traditions of the Church are also its weaknesses. The major restrictions that may hinder the progress of the Church are many and varied and include issues such as mandatory celibacy for priests and the prohibition of women priests. Nevertheless, the Holy Spirit of Hope will be with us all as we move forward in faith.” Brislin has been outspoken about the challenges facing South Africa, including poverty, corruption, and the need for ethical leadership. He has emphasized the importance of the Church’s role in addressing these issues and promoting human dignity. In January 2018, he visited the Gaza Strip as part of the annual Holy Land Coordination, an international effort of bishops supporting peace and communication. He has also demonstrated a special concern for migrants, particularly the Basotho people, whom he ministered to in his early priesthood and time as bishop. He has also led four pilgrimages for The Southern Cross, covering nine territories including Italy, Palestine, Israel, Egypt, Spain, and Portugal. Brislin was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Pastoral Leadership by the Oblate School of Theology in San Antonio, Texas, on May 5, 2023. During his long tenure in Cape Town which began in 2009, priestly vocations remained roughly the same while numbers of male and female religious have dropped by about a third. His language proficiency has not been listed but apart from English, he is expected to speak Afrikaans and perhaps has some familiarity with Sesotho. Asked in early December 2023 about being a potential papal candidate, he said it was “technically” possible but that he did not think he had the “worldwide experience that most of the other cardinals have.” He added: “You mustn’t forget, I’m really small-fry in comparison to some of these real giants, people of great intellect and a lot of experience. “I mean, you take Archbishop [Víctor Manuel] Fernández, for example: he’s written 300 books or something. You know, he’s really a person who’s got a very broad vision. And it’s people like that, I think, who would be more likely to be candidates for the papacy.”2","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Brislin embraces a progressive and heterodox perspective, advocating for social issues, LGBTQ+ inclusion, and a reexamination of traditional Church teachings.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is recognized for his strong leadership skills and ability to engage in dialogue on contentious issues within the Church.

38,Raymond Leo Burke,"The youngest of six children in a family closely connected to its Irish immigrant roots, Cardinal Raymond Burke grew up on a rural dairy farm in the American Midwest. He recalls with fondness the instruction in the Catholic Faith that he received from his parents, an Irish Catholic father and an American Baptist mother who converted to the Faith after meeting her husband.1 His father died of a brain tumor when Raymond was eight. After time as a seminarian at the Catholic University of America in the United States where he was a Basselin philosophy scholar, he was sent to Rome, where he studied at the Jesuits’ Pontifical Gregorian University, which counts more popes as graduates than any other university in the world. In 1975, on the Solemnity of Sts. Peter and Paul, June 29, he was ordained a priest by Paul VI. After a few years of pastoral work and teaching, he was sent back to the Gregorian, where he completed a doctorate in canon law before returning in 1983 to the Diocese of La Crosse, Wisconsin, where he served as moderator of the Curia and vice chancellor. John Paul II called Burke back to Rome a third time in 1989 to serve the Apostolic Signatura as the first American appointed defender of the bond. At this time, Burke also taught canon law at his alma mater. In 1995, Burke was ordained bishop by John Paul II and appointed as bishop of La Crosse. During his tenure, Bishop Burke conceived of building a great shrine dedicated to Our Lady of Guadalupe, patroness of the Americas. It was finally dedicated in 2008, by which time he had been archbishop of Saint Louis, Missouri, for five years. Amid his many pastoral duties, he continued publishing scholarly works. Widely recognized as an expert in canon law, Burke was brought back to Rome a fourth time when Benedict XVI appointed him prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, effectively the Church’s “supreme court.” He was elevated to cardinal in 2010, and since then he has continued his work in canon law among many other apostolates.2 In 2014, Cardinal Burke’s term at the Apostolic Signatura ended, and instead of renewing it, Pope Francis appointed him patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. In 2017, Pope Francis returned him to the Apostolic Signatura, appointing him member of the Church’s highest court to allow him to serve as one of the court’s judges when needed. A week before he turned 75 in June 2023, Pope Francis replaced Cardinal Burke as cardinal patron of the Order of Malta, although he had been in that role without responsibilities since 2017. Widely recognized as one of the Church’s foremost experts in canon law, Raymond Burke is also known worldwide for his international apostolic work, including his support for right-to-life causes, the traditional liturgy, his devotion to the Holy Eucharist, the Blessed Virgin Mary, and the Sacred Heart. Cardinal Burke’s devotion to the Blessed Virgin was manifested in his successful project to build the Shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe in La Crosse, Wisconsin. As a diocesan bishop, he promoted the growth of religious life within his diocese and enforced discipline when necessary. He has been especially firm in defending both the sacrality of the sacraments and the inviolability of all human life, most notably withholding Holy Communion from Catholic legislators who promote abortion. In his curial experience as previous prefect of the Apostolic Signatura, as well as other curial appointments, he has manifested a commitment to implementing the teachings of the Church in accordance with Catholic tradition and the Second Vatican Council but purposely resisted entering into petty games within the Curia, adhering instead to applying Church law with fairness and justice. Cardinal Burke is known for his fidelity to the revealed doctrine of the Church, a characteristic that, at times, has provoked vociferous criticism from those within the Church who often cannot accept those teachings. He has responded with meekness and prayer while remaining steadfast to his convictions, leading many of the faithful to look to him for guidance when they have doubts or are confused about the Church’s leadership. Those of sound formation see a bishop who is reliably Catholic and able to resolve issues of faith, be they doctrinal or canonical. And despite him being stripped of almost every ecclesiastical role, with the exception of bishop and cardinal, often they will seek out Cardinal Burke when they visit Rome — a sign, some believe, of both his personal sanctity and the sensus fidelium in action. He makes time to see visitors if he is available and freely imparts his advice. Ever willing to promote the good of souls and society, he has given his name to many Catholic groups, associations, educational institutes, and projects that work toward those ends. He has latterly made use of the digital media to promote his teaching office. As well as his native English, Cardinal Burke is proficient in Latin, French, Italian, and while he may not be an expert in Spanish, he has delivered bilingual homilies and is capable of preaching and writing in the language. His relationship with Pope Francis has been strained as the cardinal has been unafraid to often criticize the pontificate when he has thought it necessary. This reached its apotheosis in 2023 when Francis removed his stipend, pension and healthcare, and attempted to evict him from his Vatican apartment on the grounds that he had been “working against the Church and against the papacy” and that he had sown “disunity” in the Church. For his part, Burke sees his role as supportive and believes it is his obligation as a cardinal adviser to the Pope to offer constructive criticism, always drawing on the faith, reason and apostolic tradition. A point of reference for the faithful worldwide who look for a voice of clarity and coherence with apostolic tradition from cardinals on matters facing the Church today, Cardinal Burke is known as a reliable proponent of orthodoxy and traditional Catholic piety, and a prelate with a deep concern for the salvation of souls. In 2021, the cardinal was taken very ill with Covid and came close to death. He firmly believes his recovery was miraculous due to the intercession of the Blessed Mother and the many prayers of the faithful. He is convinced he was saved for “some future work the Lord” has for him to do.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Burke is a staunch advocate for traditional Catholic teachings, emphasizing the sanctity of the sacraments and the inviolability of human life.

39,François-Xavier Bustillo,"Cardinal François-Xavier Bustillo, the Bishop of Ajaccio, Corsica, since 2021, is a French Catholic prelate of Spanish origin who has shown himself to be acutely aware of the crisis in the Church and hopeful about its resolution. A moderate reformist whose vision for the Church largely aligns with that of Pope Francis, he is a member of the Conventual Franciscans and was elevated to the rank of cardinal by Pope Francis on September 30, 2023. Born on November 23, 1968, in Pamplona, Spain, Bustillo is one of the youngest members of the College of Cardinals. He entered the minor seminary of Baztan, Navarre, before joining the Order of Conventual Franciscans in Padua, Italy. He completed his philosophical and theological studies at the Istituto Teologico Sant’Antonio Dottore in Padua and earned a licentiate in theology from the Catholic University of Toulouse in 1997. Throughout his career, Bustillo has held several significant positions. In 1994, he was part of the team that included controversial Conventual Franciscan Friar Daniel Marie Thevenet that established the Convent of Saint Bonaventure in Narbonne, France. From 2006 to 2018, he served as the Provincial Custos of the Conventual Franciscans for France and Belgium. He also worked in the diocese of Carcassonne-Narbonne, where he was a parish priest, a member of the diocesan council, and an episcopal vicar. In 2018, Bustillo was appointed guardian of the convent of Saint-Maximilien-Kolbe in Lourdes, France. On May 11, 2021, Pope Francis appointed him Bishop of Ajaccio, and he received his episcopal consecration on June 13 of the same year. He was elevated to cardinal on September 30, 2023, making him the first bishop of Ajaccio to receive this honor. In April 2022, Pope Francis gave an Italian-language version of Bustillo’s book Witnesses, Not Officials to each of the priests attending the Chrism Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica on Holy Thursday. The book, originally published in French as La vocation du prêtre face aux crises: La fidélité créatrice, focuses on the challenges facing priestly ministry in today’s world and offers insights on how priests can be authentic witnesses of the Gospel rather than mere administrators.1 Bustillo has been the subject of controversy due to his ties with Thévenet. Inspired by the Charismatic Renewal, Thevenet has attracted criticism for “charismatic and mystical-spiritual excesses” such as his “healing prayers” and including them in the Mass, a practice which has been forbidden by the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith.  Bustillo was one of the three co-founders of the convent of Narbonne alongside Thevenet. Bustillo has acknowledged tensions within the Catholic Church and said in 2023 that many Catholics are currently afraid. They are afraid of “growing secularism, afraid when the Pope calls for greater responsibility in front of the tragedies of migrants, afraid that he will upset the Church when he convenes a synod on its future,” Cardinal Bustillo said. “We are in a ‘hope and love deficit’ inside the Church at the moment,” Cardinal Bustillo continued in comments to OSV News. “We divide ourselves instead of supporting one another.” Bustillo is known for his positive outlook and inclusive approach to ministry. He emphasizes the importance of authenticity in Christian life, especially in secularized environments like France. He advocates unity within the Church, recognizing the beauty of differences and encouraging various expressions of faith. Bustillo has also played a significant role in promoting peace and reconciliation, particularly during times of tension in Corsica. In the same OSV News interview, he showed tolerance for the traditional liturgy, possibly pointing to his own opposition to restrictions placed on it. “Some are attached to the traditional liturgy, others are more charismatic,” he said. “Ecclesial maturity is about everyone being what helps him become better. Some need the beauty of the liturgy – let them continue. Others need to reach out to the world – let them. Differences are beautiful and should not lead to division.” On the crisis in the Church, he said: “There have always been lean times in the Church” but added: “I am confident! The Church is not dead! She can provide abundant values of life and joy in a society bathed in vagueness.” Cardinal Bustillo is multilingual. He speaks French with a unique accent that reflects his diverse background, and is said to speak Spanish and Italian fluently.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Bustillo is a moderate reformist aligned with Pope Francis, advocating for unity and inclusivity within the Church amidst contemporary challenges.

40,Mykola Bychok,"Cardinal Mykola Bychok is a prelate of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church in Melbourne, Australia, who at just 44 became the youngest prelate to have been elevated to the College of Cardinals for many years. Born on February 13, 1980, in Ternopil, Ukraine, Bychok heard a calling to be a priest at the age of fifteen and joined priests of the Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer (Redemptorists) on missions and retreats at various monasteries. The lives of the Redemptorist missionaries and their zeal in the preaching of God’s Word made a deep impression on him and in 1997 he joined the order. He then underwent theological training in Ukraine and Poland, professed his final vows in 2003, and was ordained priest on May 3, 2005. Bychok served various roles within the Church, including as a missionary in Prokopyevsk, Russia, and later as a parish priest and provincial bursar in Ukraine. He also spent time in the United States as vicar of the Ukrainian Catholic parish of Saint John the Baptist in Newark, New Jersey. In January 2020, Pope Francis appointed him as the Eparchial Bishop of the Ukrainian Catholic Eparchy of Saints Peter and Paul in Melbourne, Australia. His episcopal consecration took place on June 7, 2020. Bychok’s leadership has been marked by a commitment to fostering community among the Ukrainian diaspora in Australia and addressing challenges such as secularization and youth engagement within the Church. Pope Francis created Bychok a cardinal on December 7, 2024, making him the youngest cardinal at that time. Bychok expressed his surprise and excitement regarding this honor, emphasizing that it represents not just a personal accolade but a recognition of the entire Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church and its community in Australia. Cardinal Bychok has faced challenges related to maintaining cultural identity within an aging congregation and adapting to the needs of younger generations who may not speak Ukrainian fluently. He has highlighted the importance of integrating English into church services to better connect with youth while preserving traditional practices. Cardinal Mykola Bychok speaks several languages. He speaks Ukrainian, which is essential for his liturgical duties and community engagement within the Ukrainian diaspora. Additionally, he communicates in English and likely has proficiency in Polish due to his studies there. On hearing the news of his elevation to the cardinalate, Bychock said he would endeavor to “follow the worthy example of my predecessor Cardinals: Patriarch Josyf Cardinal Slipyj, who, after his release after eighteen years in a Soviet gulag and moving to Rome, became the voice of our Church in the free world and, using various forums, emphasized the persecution of the Churches in the USSR and called for more radical actions to protect the rights of believers.”","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Mykola Bychok emphasizes the importance of cultural identity and community engagement within the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, particularly in addressing secularization and youth involvement.

41,Luis Gerardo Cabrera Herrera,"Cardinal Luis Gerardo Cabrera Herrera, the Archbishop of Guayaquil, is an Ecuadorian prelate best known for his peacemaking efforts in his country as well as his vocal opposition to abortion and gender ideology. Born on October 11, 1955, in Azogues, Ecuador, Cabrera entered the Franciscan novitiate in 1975 at the age of 19. He made his solemn vows in 1982 and was ordained priest on September 3, 1983. Cabrera’s rise through the Church hierarchy has been marked by several significant appointments. In April 2009, at the age of 53, he was appointed Archbishop of Cuenca, Ecuador. He was consecrated bishop on July 4, 2009. His leadership skills and dedication to the Church were further recognized when he was appointed Archbishop of Guayaquil, Ecuador, in September 2015. As a leader in the Catholic Church in Ecuador, Cabrera has held numerous high-ranking positions within the Franciscan order, including roles in Latin America and the Caribbean. His influence extends beyond Ecuador, as evidenced by his appointment as a member of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life in 2014. Cardinal Cabrera is perhaps best known for his efforts to promote dialogue and peace in Ecuador. He has played a crucial role in mediating during times of social unrest, particularly following anti-government protests triggered by austerity measures. His work has earned him a reputation as a peacemaker in the country. Cabrera has been a vocal critic of gender ideology in Ecuador. In 2017, he supported a lay initiative to march in favor of the family and life, opposing efforts to legalize abortion and incorporate gender ideology in the school curriculum. His strong stance on these issues has made him a controversial figure in some circles. Cardinal Cabrera drew headlines in late 2023 when abortion due to rape was legalized in Ecuador by a judicial decision. Cabrera stated that the Supreme Court judges who voted in favor of legalization had incurred latae sententiae excommunications. This statement sparked debate and highlighted his firm position on the issue of abortion. Cardinal Cabrera welcomed the document Fiducia Supplicans on the blessings of same-sex couples, but with some reservations. He stressed that marriage is only recognized as a union between a man and a woman, stating, “There’s no marriage between man with man and woman with woman.” He also clarified that there should be no simulation of a sacrament or liturgical celebration for same-sex couples, but asserted that “LGBTQ” people must be embraced and respected, not scorned. In recognition of his service and leadership, Pope Francis elevated him to cardinal on December 7, 2024.","• Theology/Ideology: Cabrera firmly upholds traditional Catholic teachings, particularly opposing abortion and gender ideology, while advocating for the sanctity of marriage as a union exclusively between a man and a woman.

42,Domenico Calcagno,"Cardinal Domenico Calcagno is an Italian prelate and retired senior Vatican official who ran the Holy See’s management of real estate and investments from 2011 until he retired in 2018 during which he was involved in some financial controversies. Born on February 3, 1943, in Tramontana di Parodi, Ligure, Italy, Calcagno has had a long and varied career within the Catholic Church. He was ordained as a priest on February 25, 1967, and holds a BA in philosophy and a doctorate in dogmatic theology. Calcagno began his service to the Church as a rector of the Oratorio di Sant’Erasmo in Genoa-Quinto for 20 years. During this time, he also taught theology at the Major Seminary in Genoa and fundamental morals at the Interdiocesan Theological Studium in Alessandria. In 1985, Calcagno was appointed President of the Diocesan Institute for the Support of the Diocesan Clergy of Genoa. He later moved to Rome, taking on several important roles, including secretary of the Italian Presbyteral Commission, national director of the Office for Inter-Church Missionary Cooperation, and President of the Central Institute for the Support of the Clergy. Calcagno received episcopal ordination on March 9, 2002, when he was appointed Bishop of Savona-Noli. He resigned from this position on August 31, 2007, to become Secretary of the Administration of the Patrimony of the Apostolic See (APSA) with the title of archbishop ad personam. On November 24, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI elevated Calcagno to the rank of cardinal. He served as President of APSA from July 7, 2011, until his retirement on June 26, 2018. Despite his distinguished career, Cardinal Calcagno has not been without controversy. He was under investigation for real estate dealings in his previous Italian diocese, which raised concerns about financial corruption within the Church. Also, while not directly implicated, Calcagno was part of the Vatican establishment that resisted financial reforms proposed by Cardinal George Pell. He was also involved in a €100 million purchase of a London property in 2015 that Pell had opposed and which was later viewed as a loss-making mistake. It is important to note that while Calcagno was not explicitly named as an opponent to Pell’s reforms, his position as president of APSA during this period placed him at the center of the financial system that was under scrutiny.","• Theology/Ideology: Calcagno's background in dogmatic theology informs his conservative approach to Church governance and financial management.

43,Antonio Cañizares Llovera,"Cardinal Antonio Cañizares Llovera is a retired and distinguished conservative Spanish prelate whose physical and theological similarities to Benedict XVI led him to being nicknamed the “Little Ratzinger.” Born on October 15, 1945, in Utiel, Spain, Canizares was ordained as a priest on June 21, 1970, and holds a doctorate in theology. Cañizares Llovera began his ecclesiastical career as a parish coadjutor, chaplain, and parish priest. He quickly rose through the ranks of the Catholic Church, serving in various important positions. On March 6, 1992, he was appointed Bishop of Avila, receiving episcopal ordination on April 25 of the same year. His career continued to advance when he was appointed Archbishop of Granada on December 10, 1996. Later, on October 24, 2002, he became the Archbishop of Toledo and Primate of Spain, a position he held until 2008. On December 9, 2008, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as Prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. Cañizares Llovera was elevated to cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in the consistory of March 24, 2006, with the title of San Pancrazio. He participated in the conclave of March 2013, which elected Pope Francis. On August 28, 2014, Pope Francis appointed him as Archbishop of Valencia, a position he held until his resignation was accepted on October 10, 2022. Throughout his ecclesiastical life, Cardinal Cañizares Llovera has made significant contributions to the Church. He has been a member of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith since 1995 and contributed to the compilation of the Spanish-language edition of the Catechism of the Catholic Church. He founded the St. Teresa of Jesus Catholic University in Avila in the 1990s and promoted a diocesan synod of 1995. Cañizares Llovera has also held several important positions within the Spanish Episcopal Conference, including president of the Episcopal Commission of Seminaries and the Episcopal Commission of Education. He was founder president of the Spanish Association of Catechists. His expertise in catechesis and theology led him to teach at various institutions, including the University of Salamanca and the Conciliar Seminary of Madrid. He also served as the director of the Institute of Religious Science and Catechesis in Madrid. In October 2015, Cañizares made headlines by questioning the arrival of refugees to Europe, wondering if “it is all clean wheat” and suggesting that they could be “the Trojan horse in European societies.” The media pushback led to him later asking for forgiveness, although he claimed to have been the victim of a “lynching” for the alleged manipulation of his words. The cardinal has openly criticized what he calls the “gay empire” and “certain feminist ideologies,” accusing them of attacking the “Christian family.” He has also called for disobeying “unjust” laws based on “gender ideology,” which he considers “the most insidious and destructive of humanity in all of history.” Cañizares has been a vocal defender of the unity of Spain and the teaching of the Catholic Religion in schools. He has made fearless comments on political issues. After the publication of Traditionis Custodes, Cardinal Canizares, who was a friend of the Traditional Latin Mass when he was head of the Vatican’s liturgical office, surprised some observers when he provisionally suspended the celebration of the Vetus Ordo in the archdiocese of Valencia.1 Shortly before the 2025 Conclave, Cardinal Canizares said he would not be participating in the election of the new pope due to ill health.","• Theology/Ideology: Cañizares Llovera is a staunch conservative who emphasizes traditional Catholic teachings and has been vocal against contemporary social issues such as gender ideology and feminism.

44,Raniero Cantalamessa,"Cardinal Raniero Cantalamessa is an Italian Capuchin Franciscan theologian who from 1980 to 2024 served as the Preacher to the Papal Household, providing meditations during Lent and Advent and at key events for the Pope and senior Vatican officials. Born on July 22, 1934, in Colli del Tronto, Italy, he was ordained as a priest in the Franciscan Capuchin order in 1958 and holds doctoral degrees in theology and classical literature. Cardinal Cantalamessa served as a professor of ancient Christian history and director of the Department of Religious Sciences at the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan until 1979 when he decided to devote himself full time to preaching. In 1980, Pope John Paul II appointed him as the Preacher to the Papal Household, a position he has held under three popes: John Paul II, Benedict XVI, and Francis. In this role, he provides weekly meditations to the Pope and other high-ranking officials during Lent and Advent. Cantalamessa made significant contributions to theology, spirituality, and ecumenical dialogue. He is a member of the Catholic Delegation for the Dialogue with the Pentecostal Churches and has been a proponent of the Catholic charismatic renewal. His teachings and writings have been widely influential, with many of his books on spirituality translated into approximately twenty languages. On November 28, 2020, Pope Francis elevated Cantalamessa to the rank of cardinal, making him Cardinal-Deacon of Sant’Apollinare alle Terme Neroniane-Alessandrine. Notably, at his request, Pope Francis granted him dispensation from the requirement to be consecrated a bishop. Due to his age (over 80 at the time of elevation), Cantalamessa is not eligible to participate in papal conclaves as a cardinal elector. Before the 2005 and 2013 papal conclaves, Cantalamessa was requested by the College of Cardinals to deliver one of the two public exhortations that introduce the conclave. This demonstrates the high regard in which he is held within the Church hierarchy. In December 2006, Cantalamessa urged Pope Benedict in an Advent sermon to declare a day of fasting and penitence in response to child sex crimes by clergy in the Roman Catholic Church. In 2010, Cantalamessa caused controversy with his Good Friday sermon in St. Peter’s Basilica when he drew parallels between the media coverage of alleged child abuse scandals in the Catholic Church and anti-Semitism – a parallel that actually came from a Jewish friend of Father Cantalamessa. He reportedly implied that the sensational coverage of alleged child abuse and cover-ups within the Roman Catholic Church was evidence of anti-Catholicism, and bore similarities to the “more shameful aspects of anti-Semitism.” The Vatican later clarified that Cantalamessa was not speaking as an official representative of the Church and that his comparison could lead to misunderstandings. In 2013, then-Father Cantalamessa preached in favor of clearing away “the residue of past ceremonials, laws and disputes, now only debris.” He referred to St. Francis of Assisi as exemplifying the creative destroyer of ecclesial traditions.1","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Cantalamessa emphasizes the importance of ecumenical dialogue and the Catholic charismatic renewal within a framework of traditional Catholic teachings.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his eloquence and ability to engage diverse audiences, he adeptly navigates complex theological discussions while fostering unity among different Christian denominations.  
• Power Base: His long tenure as Preacher to the Papal Household under three popes has solidified his influence and reputation among the Church hierarchy and clergy.

45,Oscar Cantoni,"Cardinal Oscar Cantoni, the Bishop of Como, Italy, is known for his focus on promoting Catholic education, charitable outreach and social justice work. Born on September 1, 1950 in Lenno, Italy, Cantoni attended Classical High School at the Collegio Gallio in Como of the Somaschi Fathers. After graduating from high school, he entered the Como Seminary to undertake courses in theology. Besides collaborating with spirituality magazines, in which he published articles on vocational topics, he published several books for young people. Cantoni was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Como in 1975 and served in various pastoral and administrative roles, including as a parish priest, teacher of religion, and episcopal vicar for clergy. From 1995 to 1986 he was in charge of the promotion of vocations in the seminary; collaborator in the parish of Santa Maria Regina in Como; chaplain to the Sisters at the Collegio Santa Chiara in Muggiò; and from 1986 to 1999, director of the Diocesan Vocations Centre and religious education teacher in secondary schools in Como. From 1990 to 2005, he was spiritual director of theologians in the diocesan seminary; preacher of Spiritual Exercises for priests and the Ordo Virginum in the diocese. On 11 July 2000 he was appointed Prelate of Honor of His Holiness. From 2003 to 2005 he was episcopal vicar for the clergy of Como. In 2005, Pope John Paul II appointed Cantoni as Bishop of Crema. During his time there, he initiated several notable projects, including establishing in 2009 Uni-Crema, a “free university for adults” aimed at promoting cultural and social citizenship rooted in Christian tradition. In 2010, he organized Italy’s first diocesan “youth mission,” sending young people to evangelize in places like nightclubs and theaters. Cantoni returned to lead his home diocese when Pope Francis named him Bishop of Como in 2016. His ministry there has focused on charitable outreach, particularly to migrants and the poor. In 2020, he dealt with the tragic murder of a priest in his diocese who was known for serving the homeless and migrants. Cantoni spoke of feeling the priest’s spiritual protection and blessing on his ministry after this event. As Bishop of Como, Cantoni ordained Gabriele Martinelli as a priest in 2017. Martinelli was later accused of sexually abusing a younger student when they were both pupils at the Vatican’s St. Pius X pre-seminary.1 Pope Francis elevated Cantoni to the rank of cardinal in August 2022. During his tenure in Como, the number of priests continued a declining trend, from 527 in 2016 to 458 in 2021. Male religious also continued to fall from 172 to 147 over the same period; female religious also dropped from 540 to 475. Cardinal Cantoni is a member of the Dicastery for Bishops, giving him a role in selecting future bishops. Apart from Italian, it is not clear if Cardinal Cantoni speaks any other languages.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Cantoni emphasizes the importance of Catholic education and social justice, reflecting a commitment to community service and evangelization.

46,Carlos Gustavo Castillo Mattasoglio,"Cardinal Carlos Gustavo Castillo Mattasoglio, the Archbishop of Lima, is a Peruvian prelate famous for holding heterodox positions such as views contradicting the Church’s teaching on the Lord’s death, broader views on abortion and homosexuality, and supporting liberation theology. Born on February 28, 1950, in Lima, Peru, Castillo pursued his education at Dalton de Lince College and San Agustín College in Lima before earning a bachelor’s degree in social sciences from the National University of San Marcos. His academic journey continued at the Santo Toribio di Mogrovejo major seminary in Lima and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he obtained degrees in philosophy and theology. Castillo was ordained as a priest for the Archdiocese of Lima on July 15, 1984, by Cardinal Juan Landázuri Ricketts. He further advanced his studies, earning a licentiate and doctorate in dogmatic theology from the Gregorian University in 1985 and 1987, respectively. Upon returning to Peru in 1987, he became deeply involved in various pastoral and academic roles, including serving as an assessor for the National Union of Catholic Students and lecturing in theology at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. The cardinal is reported to have always been very close to the people, especially the young and the poor. In 2013, Castillo Mattasoglio faced controversy when Cardinal Cipriani Thorne, then Archbishop of Lima, suspended him amid allegations of heterodoxy and “attacks on the ecclesiastical hierarchy.” Castillo and Cipriani could not have been more different, the latter being conservative and orthodox. In 1977, Cipriani was the first priest incardinated into Opus Dei to be made a cardinal. In 2021, Castillo drew headlines again when in a pre-Christmas Mass he contradicted the Church’s teaching on Jesus’ death. Castillo stated that Jesus died as “a layman,” and did so without offering a “sacrifice.”1 In recent years, Castillo demanded the abolition of the Sodalitium Vitae Christianae (SCV), a conservative religious group aimed at evangelizing the culture and resisting liberation theology. The movement has been hit by cases of alleged sexual and psychological abuse, physical violence, misappropriation of funds, and other crimes by former members and journalists. Castillo said SCV had “destroyed people” and there was “nothing Christian about it.” In 2024, Castillo was appointed the coordinator of study group 9 for the Synod on Synodality which is expected to discuss LGBT issues outside of the main assembly that ended in October 2024. He has reportedly shown an openness to the issue, suggesting a willingness for reform in that area and the normalization of homosexual relations in the Church. Castillo has also shown a “nuanced” position on the issue of abortion. In relation to Peru’s March for Life, the cardinal considered it necessary for society to reflect on the issue more broadly. “If we have to march, we have to do it for all lives and for the lives of everyone […] for equality for people of different sexes and different situations,” he said in 2019. In 2024, Cardinal Castillo co-wrote a book called “A Post-Clerical Church: Authority and Gospel,” [Una Chiesa post-clericale: Autorità e Vangelo]. The volume imagines a different Catholicism, one involving a renewal of the Church’s structure and approach to power. The book includes themes such as overcoming the separation between clergy and laity; addressing issues of power abuse within the Church; seeking a new form of Church based on the “People of God” concept from Vatican II, and promoting a more participatory and inclusive Church structure. Cardinal Castillo’s contribution forms part of the book’s overall goal of re-imagining Church authority and structure in a way which its authors believe is more faithful to the New Testament teachings and responsive to contemporary cultural and spiritual needs. Praising the book in L’Osservatore Romano, Bishop Derio Olivero of Pinero, Italy, said the cardinal “helps us to make an interesting journey in the texture of the Gospel to go and find in it, from the beginning, attention to not falling into clericalism.” Despite his controversial words and actions, Pope Francis appointed Castillo Archbishop of Lima on January 25, 2019, and he was installed three months later. Among the notable figures attending was one of liberation theology’s founders, Gustavo Gutiérrez, who had formally called for Castillo’s ordination as bishop. Castillo has long been associated with liberation theology. The Peruvian cardinal’s appointment was seen as significant, with some describing it as an “ecclesial earthquake” due to his background in liberation theology, his heterodoxy, and his differences with his predecessor.","• Theology/Ideology: Castillo holds heterodox positions that challenge traditional Church teachings, advocating for liberation theology and a reimagined Church structure.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his strong connection with the youth and marginalized communities, promoting inclusivity and dialogue on controversial issues.  
• Power Base: Castillo's influence stems from his academic credentials, pastoral experience, and support from progressive factions within the Church, including notable figures in liberation theology.

47,Gregorio Rosa Chávez,"Cardinal Gregorio Rosa Chávez, the Church’s first cardinal from El Salvador, was a close collaborator and friend of Saint Óscar Romero and is committed to social justice work. Born on September 3, 1942, in Sociedad, El Salvador, Rosa Chávez completed his philosophical and theological studies at the San José de la Montaña Central Seminary in San Salvador from 1962 to 1964 and 1966 to 1969. He furthered his education at the progressive Catholic University of Leuven, Belgium, from 1973 to 1976, obtaining a licentiate in social communication. Ordained as a priest on January 24, 1970, Rosa Chávez served in various roles within the Church. He was appointed as auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese of San Salvador on July 3, 1982, a position he held until his retirement on October 4, 2022. Rosa Chávez first met Saint Óscar Romero, the slain Archbishop of San Salvador, around 1956 and worked for him after completing his philosophical studies. The cardinal has been a vocal advocate for Romero’s canonization and attended his beatification in 2015. In a surprising move, Pope Francis elevated Rosa Chávez to the rank of cardinal on June 28, 2017, making him the first cardinal from El Salvador. The appointment was unusual as Rosa Chávez was only an auxiliary bishop at the time. He visited Romero’s tomb shortly after receiving news of his elevation. Throughout his career, Rosa Chávez has been outspoken about government abuses and social issues. He has been a critic of El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele’s harsh measures against gang members, arguing that the means do not justify the ends. He has opposed the Salvadoran government’s “state of exception” that allows for the mass incarceration of suspected gang members without due process, and has expressed concern about innocent young men being detained mistakenly and the dehumanizing treatment of prisoners. Rosa Chávez has faced challenges due to his outspoken nature. During El Salvador’s 1979-1992 civil war, he strongly criticized government abuses and publicly identified alleged killers of six Jesuits, which led to him being labeled a “communist priest” and receiving death threats. Overall, he has been critical of both left-wing and right-wing politics in El Salvador, calling the country “politically contaminated” and criticizing political violence from all sides. He has been described as having “carefully balanced opinions on controversial topics such as gang warfare, abortion and poverty.” Throughout his career, Cardinal Rosa Chávez has remained committed to the principles of social justice and the legacy of Saint Óscar Romero, often advocating for the poor and marginalized in El Salvador. Besides his native Spanish, Cardinal Rosa Chávez speaks French and has a general knowledge of English, Portuguese, and Italian.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Rosa Chávez advocates for social justice and draws inspiration from the legacy of Saint Óscar Romero in addressing contemporary issues.

48,Fernando Natalio Chomalí Garib,"Cardinal Fernando Natalio Chomalí Garib, the Metropolitan Archbishop of Santiago de Chile, is a moral theologian and bioethicist who became a trusted adviser to Pope Francis during the 2018 clerical sex abuse scandals in Chile. Born on March 10, 1957, in Santiago de Chile, Chomali comes from a family with Palestinian roots and is one of five children born to Juan Chomalí Celse and Vitalia Garib Aguad. His academic journey is marked by a diverse educational background. Chomalí initially studied at the Colegio de Alianza Francesa and the National Institute of Santiago. In 1981, he earned a degree in civil engineering from the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile. His calling to religious life led him to study philosophy and theology at the Pontifical Major Seminary of Santiago from 1984. After his ordination to the priesthood on April 6, 1991, Chomalí pursued further studies in Rome. He obtained a licentiate in moral theology from the Pontifical Alphonsian Academy in 1993, followed by a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in 1994. In 1998, he completed a master’s degree in bioethics from the John Paul II Pontifical Theological Institute for Marriage and Family Sciences. Chomalí has worked as a parish vicar, episcopal delegate for university pastoral care, professor of moral theology and bioethics in the Faculties of Theology and Medicine of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile and in the Major Seminary of Santiago; as parish priest of Santa María de la Misericordia, moderator of the Curia and president delegate of the Economic Council of the archdiocese. Chomalí’s rise through the ranks of the Catholic Church has been steady and notable. In April 2006, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as titular bishop of Noba and auxiliary bishop of Santiago de Chile, and he received his episcopal consecration three month’s later. In April 2011, Pope Benedict XVI promoted him to Archbishop of Concepción. He served in this role for over a decade, until in October 2023, Pope Francis appointed him as the Metropolitan Archbishop of Santiago de Chile. He was officially installed in this position two months later. Throughout his career, Chomalí has held several important positions within the Church. He has been a member of the Pontifical Academy for Life since 2001 and served on its steering committee from 2010 to 2012. His membership was renewed in 2017, highlighting his ongoing contributions to the field of bioethics. From March 2014 to March 2015, he served as the apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Osorno, demonstrating his leadership capabilities in times of transition. While there, in the final days of his assignment, Chomalí met with Pope Francis to discuss Francis’ appointment of Juan Barros as Osorno’s new bishop. This appointment had caused significant controversy due to Barros’ alleged involvement in covering up sexual abuse cases. Chomalí, who had a long-standing friendship with Juan Carlos Cruz, a victim of sexual abuse, attempted to convey the negative impact of this appointment to the Pope. In response to the broader sexual abuse crisis within the Church, Chomalí issued a pastoral letter in September 2018 calling for full cooperation with civil authorities and acknowledged the Church’s loss of credibility. He proposed several reforms, including separating offices handling abuse complaints from other diocesan offices and implementing new transparency rules for seminaries and Church judicial proceedings.1 In 2021, Chomalí was elected vice president of the Episcopal Conference of Chile, further cementing his influential role within the Church in Chile. Cardinal Chomali re-authorized the celebration of the Vetus Ordo (Old Latin Mass) after four years of its being restricted under his predecessor. On December 8, 2024, the liturgical feast of the Immaculate Conception, the celebration of the Holy Mass according to the 1962 Mass resumed in the archdiocese and will be celebrated every Sunday and on feast days.

49,Stephen Chow Sau-yan,"Cardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan is a progressive-leaning Jesuit prelate known for his diplomacy and skills in education who in 2023 was the first Bishop of Hong Kong to visit Beijing since 1985. Born on August 7, 1959 in Hong Kong, Chow joined the Society of Jesus in 1984 after completing his studies in psychology at the University of Minnesota in the US. He was ordained priest in 1994 and continued his education, earning a doctorate in human development and psychology from Harvard University in 2006. Throughout his career, Chow has been deeply involved in education. He served as supervisor of two Jesuit colleges in Hong Kong and held teaching positions at various institutions, including the University of Hong Kong and the Holy Spirit Seminary. His expertise in psychology and education has informed his approach to leadership within the Church. In May 2021, Pope Francis appointed Chow as the Bishop of Hong Kong, a position he initially declined but later accepted “out of obedience”. His appointment came at a sensitive time, as Hong Kong was experiencing political tensions and the Vatican was navigating its relationship with China following its controversial and secret provisional 2018 accord with Beijing. Chow’s selection was seen as strategic, given his Jesuit background, his psychological expertise, his skills in diplomacy, and his perceived ability to potentially bridge divides between China and the Church. A notable event in Chow’s tenure was his visit to Beijing in April 2023, marking the first visit by a Hong Kong bishop to the Chinese capital since 1985. This visit was seen as a significant step in fostering dialogue between the Catholic Church and Chinese authorities. He visited China again in 2024 with a 10-person delegation. On September 30, 2023, Pope Francis elevated Chow to the rank of cardinal, making him the fourth cardinal in Hong Kong’s history. The appointment further emphasized the strategic importance of Hong Kong in the Church’s relationship with China. Chow has been willing to raise some sensitive issues with the Communist authorities, and has advocated limits to the territory’s highly contentious Security Act. But his approach has been more characterized by a focus on dialogue, reconciliation, and bridge-building, and the cardinal has generally avoided direct confrontation with Beijing, preferring to take a more conciliatory, Ostpolitik stance. Some critics have expressed concerns about this approach. They say that Chow has been too eager to give concessions to Beijing, and may be conflating the Chinese people with the Chinese Communist Party regime. He has been criticized, for example, for having what his critics believe is a naive approach to Sinicization1 and for not taking a strong stance in support of Jimmy Lai, a Catholic entrepreneur and pro-democracy activist jailed without trial for four years by the Communist authorities.2 The Hong Kong cardinal has said that the leaders in Beijing “really appreciate” Pope Francis because “he doesn’t criticise,” suggesting that he, too, may be following a similar approach of not openly criticizing the Chinese government’s actions. Critics have said that a regime that is committing crimes against humanity will naturally like a global leader who doesn’t call them out for their atrocities.3 His supporters, meanwhile, believe he is being suitably diplomatic with China in a process of dialogue that will require patience to see fruits. Cardinal Chow has many similar views to Pope Francis and sees synodality positively and important for the Church. Synodality, he has said, is “a dream that we want to come true” and “something we have to learn, with humility, with love.” He believes the discussion process can help make the Church more relevant to the world and to fellow Catholics. Synodality is “not a natural intuition for people,” he has said, but is “the way forward, beyond polarization, beyond being self-referential.” The cardinal was a synod delegate at both Rome assemblies of the Synod on Synodality. At a side event of the 2024 meeting hosted by American Jesuit Father James Martin’s LGBT advocacy group Outreach, Cardinal Chow gave the following opening prayer: “O, Holy Spirit send us your guiding light of truth, so that our ignorance and prejudices can melt away through this synodal encounter, and a new morn marked by mutual respect and empathic understanding can take shape in our church for our LGBTQ+ sisters and brothers, as well as for ourselves and our Church as a whole.” The prayer was criticized for seeming to suggest that adhering to Church doctrine on homosexuality was synonymous with ignorance and prejudice. Cardinal Chow is fluent in Cantonese, English and knows some Italian.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Chow advocates for synodality and a more inclusive Church, emphasizing dialogue and reconciliation over polarization.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his diplomatic skills, Chow approaches sensitive issues with a focus on building bridges rather than confrontation.  
• Power Base: As the first Bishop of Hong Kong to visit Beijing in decades, he has established a significant presence in both the local Church and in relations with Chinese authorities.  
• Core Motivation: Chow is driven by a desire to foster understanding and relevance within the Church, particularly in navigating complex political landscapes.","Cardinal Stephen Chow Sau-yan is a proponent of synodality and inclusivity within the Church, prioritizing dialogue and reconciliation in addressing contemporary issues.

50,Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne,"Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani Thorne is a retired Peruvian prelate of Opus Dei known for his orthodoxy on moral and social issues and for his distinguished leadership within the Catholic Church. Born on December 28, 1943 in Lima, Peru, Cipriani began his journey as an industrial engineer and champion basketball player1 before joining Opus Dei in 1962. He was ordained as a priest of Opus Dei in 1977 in Madrid and obtained a doctorate in theology from the University of Navarra in Spain. Cipriani’s ecclesiastical career progressed rapidly. He was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Ayacucho in 1988, promoted to Archbishop of Ayacucho in 1995 during the trying times of the Shining Path terrorist violence, and then became Archbishop of Lima in 1999. Pope John Paul II elevated him to cardinal in 2001. Throughout his career, Cipriani was unafraid to uphold orthodoxy and orthopraxis. In 2008, he banned the practice of receiving Communion in the hand, requiring the faithful to receive on the tongue instead. He has also been a vocal opponent of abortion, saying on television in 2016: “Statistics tell us that girls get abortions, but it is not because these girls were violated, but because, often, the woman puts herself on provoking display.”2 Cipriani has also spoken out against gender ideology, stressing that the structure of society that “is made up of men and women.”  A few days earlier, he said that campaigns to undermine the dignity of women as women and mothers, seeking to impose the so-called gender ideology, were “not humane.” The cardinal has also been a vocal critic of same-sex relationships and regularly denounced efforts to recognize homosexual unions. In 2005, Cipriani commented on the recent legalization of same-sex unions in Spain and denounced the existence of a worldwide campaign, warning that by legalizing same-sex unions, society is “disfigured.”3 Cipriani was chancellor of the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru (PUCP) in 1997 when it barred a homosexual student organization from holding events. He had a pamphlet titled “Sexual Identity: Is It Possible to Choose?” prepared and distributed which described homosexuality as a curable illness. One of Cipriani’s most notable achievements was leading the March for Life in Lima, which in 2018 brought together 800,000 people in defense of the right to life. He also attempted to mediate during a siege of the Japanese ambassador’s residence in Lima from 1996 to 1997. In 2004, Peru’s Truth Commission investigated human rights abuses committed by government forces during the 1980s and 1990s and concluded that Cipriani had failed to defend human rights while auxiliary bishop and archbishop of Ayacucho. The period marked by conflict with the Shining Path terrorist group. Cipriani rejected the report’s findings. In 1991, he criticized organizations using human rights for political gain and exploitation. “Most institutions called ‘human rights defense’ are the backbones of political movements, almost always of the Marxist and Maoist type,” he said.4 In 1995, Cipriani supported an amnesty for state military officials accused of war crimes, saying he believed it would “achieve internal peace, because it is necessary to forgive to achieve reconciliation.” Cipriani reportedly helped save many young people in Ayacucho from being recruited by the Shining Path. As one witness, Alfredo Gildemeister, recalled in 2019: “At night, during the curfews in Ayacucho, [Cipriani] would sneak out through the dark streets to bring them to hide them in his house, in order to save them from the terrible Shining Path recruitments. Luckily, those passing by or the patrolling soldiers there didn’t see him.” In the late 2000s, Cipriani entered into a long running battle with the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru lasting almost ten years over his attempts to control the university’s financial and academic affairs. Although Pope Benedict supported him, Pope Francis resolved the dispute with an accord but one that sidelined Cipriani. From 2014 to 2020, the cardinal was also a member of the Vatican’s Council for the Economy which oversaw the Vatican’s financial institutions and reform of Vatican finances under Pope Francis. In May 2018, Peru’s Congress awarded Cardinal Juan Luis Cipriani the prestigious Medal of Honor in the Degree of Grand Cross in recognition of his “outstanding pastoral life and evangelizing work, his career as primate of the Catholic Church of Peru, and his commitment to peace in our country.” Cipriani voted in the 2005 and 2013 conclaves and was considered papabile in both of them.","• Theology/Ideology: Cipriani is known for his strong adherence to traditional Catholic teachings, particularly on moral issues such as abortion and same-sex relationships.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He exhibits a decisive and authoritative demeanor, often taking bold stances that may polarize opinions among church leaders and laity alike.  
• Power Base: His influence stems from his leadership within Opus Dei and his significant roles in the Catholic Church in Peru, particularly as Archbishop of Lima.

51,Manuel do Nascimento Clemente,"Il Cardinale Manuel José Macário do Nascimento Clemente, ex Patriarca di Lisbona di orientamento conservatore, è un forte sostenitore del dialogo e un abile comunicatore che ha svolto un ruolo di primo piano nella Giornata Mondiale della Gioventù 2023 nel suo Paese. Nato il 16 luglio 1948 a Torres Vedras, vicino a Lisbona, è stato ordinato sacerdote nel 1979 dopo aver conseguito le lauree in storia, teologia e teologia storica. La sua carriera iniziale si è concentrata sulla formazione in seminario e sul lavoro accademico, diventando professore presso l’Università Cattolica del Portogallo e conseguendo il dottorato in teologia nel 1992. L’ascesa di Clemente nella gerarchia della Chiesa è iniziata con la sua nomina a Vescovo ausiliario di Lisbona nel 1999 da parte di Papa Giovanni Paolo II. Nel 2007, Papa Benedetto XVI lo ha nominato Vescovo di Porto, la seconda città più grande del Portogallo. Le sue capacità di leadership e di comunicazione sono state riconosciute e hanno portato alla sua elezione a Vicepresidente della Conferenza Episcopale Portoghese nel 2011. Nel 2013, Papa Francesco ha nominato Clemente Patriarca di Lisbona, facendolo diventare il capo della Chiesa cattolica portoghese. Nel 2015 è stato elevato al rango di Cardinale. Come Patriarca, Clemente ha svolto un ruolo cruciale nell’organizzazione e nell’accoglienza della Giornata Mondiale della Gioventù 2023 a Lisbona, che ha visto oltre 1,5 milioni di giovani riunirsi nella capitale portoghese. Nel corso della sua carriera, Clemente si è distinto per le sue forti capacità di comunicazione e per il suo impegno culturale. È autore di diversi libri sulla storia della Chiesa, sulla teologia e sulle questioni contemporanee. Nel 2009, ha ricevuto il Prix Pessoa, il più alto riconoscimento culturale del Portogallo, diventando la prima figura religiosa a ricevere questo premio civile. Clemente è stato anche coinvolto in diversi ruoli vaticani, tra cui quello di membro del Pontificio Consiglio per le Comunicazioni Sociali dal 2011 e la partecipazione al Sinodo dei Vescovi per la Nuova Evangelizzazione nel 2012 e al Sinodo Straordinario sulla Famiglia nel 2014. Negli ultimi anni, Clemente ha dovuto affrontare la questione degli abusi sessuali all’interno della Chiesa cattolica portoghese. All’inizio del 2023, un rapporto di una commissione indipendente ha rivelato che almeno 4.815 minori sono stati abusati sessualmente da membri del clero dal 1950. Clemente ha riconosciuto gli “errori del passato” e si è detto pronto a chiedere perdono alle vittime. Ha descritto questo periodo come il più difficile del suo patriarcato. Clemente è stato lodato per la sua “difesa del dialogo e della tolleranza” e per il suo lavoro di lotta contro l’esclusione sociale. È stato anche caratterizzato come un “buon pastore” e un uomo di fede e di cultura che è in contatto con il suo gregge, consapevole e sensibile alle sue esigenze, e “sa interpretare i segni dei tempi”. Il cardinale ha una visione ortodossa del matrimonio e della famiglia. Ha detto di ritenere sconsigliabile accettare omosessuali nei seminari e, di conseguenza, nel sacerdozio. Per quanto riguarda il matrimonio e l’adozione da parte di coppie dello stesso sesso, il Cardinale Clemente ha sostenuto che “l’adozione da parte di coppie dello stesso sesso va contro ciò che è sempre stato dimostrato”. L’ex Patriarca di Lisbona mantiene anche una posizione ferma contro l’ aborto e l’eutanasia. Ha detto che “possiamo solo rifiutare l’aborto e l’eutanasia e tutto ciò che può portare ad essi”. Ha difeso “l’integrità della vita” e chiede “il rispetto legale e il sostegno concreto alla vita più fragile”. Fonti della Chiesa portoghese lo descrivono come un “apparente conservatore” con posizioni piuttosto classiche sulla morale, simili a quelle di Papa San Giovanni Paolo II, ma anche con alcuni punti di vista modernisti e liberali. Ha assunto la stessa linea di Papa Francesco sulla Messa tradizionale in latino e ha istruito il suo gregge ad obbedire alla Traditionis Custodes, anche se in seguito ha fatto alcune concessioni. È noto per essere un prelato affascinante, benvoluto dall’intellighenzia portoghese e che cerca di evitare il confronto. Nell’agosto 2023, il Papa ha accettato le dimissioni di Clemente da Patriarca di Lisbona, poco dopo la conclusione della Giornata Mondiale della Gioventù e il suo 75° compleanno, segnando la fine della sua decennale guida della diocesi di Lisbona. Durante il mandato del Cardinale Clemente come Patriarca, il numero di sacerdoti e religiosi è rimasto stabile.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Clemente holds a conservative stance on traditional family values, opposing same-sex marriage and adoption by same-sex couples.

52,José Cobo Cano,"Cardinal José Cobo Cano, the Metropolitan Archbishop of Madrid, is a relatively youthful and loyal supporter of Pope Francis whose progressive views, especially on social issues, closely match and even exceed those of the Pope. Born on September 20, 1965 in Sabiote, Jaén, in southern Spain, Cobo Cano has a licentiate in civil law; a bachelor’s in theology, and a master’s degree in moral social theology. Before entering the seminary, José Cobo Cano had already completed his degree in law, and his training in both the civil and ecclesiastical spheres is said to have contributed to his pastoral profile and his experience in various fields, including teaching. After his ordination as a priest in 1994, Cobo Cano served in various pastoral roles in Madrid, including as a parish priest and archpriest. In 2017, he was appointed as an auxiliary bishop of Madrid. Within the Spanish Episcopal Conference, he has been involved in social issues, particularly in the areas of migration and human promotion. Pope Francis appointed Cobo Cano as Archbishop of Madrid on June 12, 2023 and just three months later elevated him to the rank of cardinal. His appointment as Archbishop of Madrid at the age of 57 was notable for breaking tradition, as his predecessors had all previously led other dioceses. Pope Francis’ decision was seen as part of a broader effort to bring a new generation of leaders with pastoral experience to prominent positions in the Church. Cobo Cano has been involved in addressing sexual abuse cases within the Church. In 2018, he played a role in reporting and criticizing the handling of a high-profile abuse case at an Opus Dei school in Bilbao. Known as having distinctly progressive leanings, the cardinal has been vocal about the Church’s need to listen to the “signs of the times” and he has been especially willing to address contemporary challenges such as migration, inequality, and the changing role of women in society and the Church. He has shown a stance of obedience and support for the Vatican’s declaration Fiducia Supplicans that allowed the blessing of same-sex couples, and reprimanded several priests in his archdiocese for a campaign of disobedience against Fiducia Supplicans. It was an “artificial controversy that has taken everything out of context,” Cobo said in an interview.  “In Madrid, we will fully implement the Pope’s teaching and apply Fiducia Supplicans with the intensity that the document deserves and demands,” he added. Cobo Cano is a strong defender of the synodal path promoted by Pope Francis. In a pastoral letter titled  “The Easter of the disciples,” he emphasized that the journey of the Church must be “in synodality,” being missionary disciples to “offer everyone the news of Jesus.” Cardinal Cobo has expressed a strong communion and loyalty towards Pope Francis, saying that “there is no Church of Jesus Christ without the Pope, whoever he may be,” and calling for unity around the pontiff. Cobo Cano sees the loss of the Church’s sociological influence as an “opportunity,” stating that it may be a “minority” but is “significant.” He also has said he believes the Catholic Church should no longer be seen as a “service provider,” especially when celebrating the sacraments, but must above all “offer meaning.” “We have to explain that man does not make himself, but comes from God… We have to explain to the poor, to migrants, to families, that it is worth living,” he said. “We have to speak of God not as an idea, but as a concrete experience,” he insisted. The cardinal is considered to have a “Bergoglian” profile, embodying the kind of revolutionary change that Francis seeks for the Church in Spain. Cardinal José Cobo Cano’s record on sexual abuse reportedly demonstrates a more proactive and victim-centered approach compared to some of his predecessors and colleagues in the Spanish Catholic Church. Apart from Spanish, it is not clear if Cardinal Cobo Cano speaks any other languages.","• Theology/Ideology: Cobo Cano embodies progressive Catholicism, advocating for social issues such as migration and equality, closely aligning with Pope Francis' vision.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his strong loyalty to the Pope and his collaborative approach, emphasizing synodality and unity within the Church.

53,Francesco Coccopalmerio,"Cardinal Francesco Coccopalmerio, a retired progressive Italian prelate and canonist, was once described as a protégé of the late Jesuit Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini and recently became the first ever cardinal to advocate creating a permanent dialogue with Freemasonry. Born on March 6, 1938, in San Giuliano Milanese, Italy, he was ordained priest on June 29, 1962, by Giovanni Montini, later Pope Paul VI. Coccopalmerio’s educational background is extensive, including a licentiate in theology, a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Gregorian University, and a doctorate in jurisprudence from the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan. Coccopalmerio’s career in the Catholic Church has been marked by significant appointments and contributions. He served in the Archdiocese of Milan, where he was appointed as an auxiliary bishop in 1993. In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as the President of the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, an important position he held until his resignation was accepted by Pope Francis in 2018. As a canon law expert, Coccopalmerio has been influential in several areas of Church governance. He played a key role in revising procedures for handling clergy sex abuse cases and applicable punishments. He has also been a member of various Vatican congregations, including the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Apostolic Signatura. Coccopalmerio participated in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis. During the pre-conclave meetings, he proposed creating a moderator of the Curia to ensure consistency among Vatican departments as they can often contradict one another. He was also mentioned in the Italian press as a possible papal candidate and even to have become “the most-voted Italian cardinal in the conclave” due to his well-received words on curial reform. In the 2014 Synod on the Family, Coccopalmerio advocated a more “pastoral approach” to complex family situations, including the possibility of allowing some Catholics in irregular marital situations to receive Holy Communion. After Amoris Laetitia was issued, he published a small booklet that attempted to clarify the document after the controversy it caused over access to Holy Communion for civilly remarried divorcees. The controversy, however, failed to die down and continues to this day. In 2017, Coccopalmerio’s secretary, Msgr. Luigi Capozzi, was arrested for hosting a licentious, drug-fueled party in a Vatican apartment owned by the cardinal. How much the cardinal knew about the incident remains unknown. In 2018, it was reported that Coccopalmerio had approached Pope Francis to partially reinstate Don Mauro Inzoli, a priest who had been laicized because of accusations against him of child abuse. The reinstatement turned out to be temporary, as Francis was later forced to defrock Inzoli again after the Italian priest was convicted of child sexual abuse in Italy’s criminal courts. In 2024, Coccopalmerio became the first cardinal to propose creating a permanent dialogue between the Church and Freemasonry. The proposal drew controversy as the Church has for centuries been firmly opposed to the secret society and banned any Catholic from joining its lodges.","• Theology/Ideology: Coccopalmerio advocates for a progressive theological stance that emphasizes pastoral approaches to complex family issues and dialogue with historically opposed groups like Freemasonry.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his diplomatic skills, he effectively navigates contentious issues within the Church, as evidenced by his proposals for reform and dialogue during the papal conclave.

Collins described the trustees’ actions as “reprehensible” and questioned their ability to fulfill their “sacred mission.” In 2018, Cardinal Collins spoke out against an “ideology test” for government funding, which would require faith-based and charitable organizations, as well as small business, to say they believe in abortion and other controversial issues. In 2015, Cardinal Collins joined 12 other cardinals in sending a letter to Pope Francis expressing serious concerns about the Synod on the Family, in particular about its working document and procedures which many believed to have been manipulated towards reaching a pre-set result. On February 11, 2023, Pope Francis accepted Collins’ resignation as Archbishop of Toronto, which he had submitted upon reaching the age of 75.

55,Angelo Comastri,"Cardinal Angelo Comastri is a retired distinguished Italian prelate who later in life held senior positions in Vatican City State including Archpriest of St. Peter’s Basilica. Born on September 17, 1943, in Sorano, Italy, he came from a humble family in the Maremma hills whose devout Catholic mother is said to have been “his true educator in life.” He finished his junior high school in the seminary of Pitigliano and his high school studies in the regional seminary at Viterbo. Comastri then completed his priestly formation in the Roman Major Seminary while enrolling at the Pontifical Lateran University where he graduated with a licentiate in theology. Ordained as a priest on March 11, 1967, Father Comastri quickly rose through the ranks of the Church hierarchy, firstly becoming vice-rector of the diocesan seminary of Pitigliano. In 1968, he was called  and later worked at the Congregation for Bishops in Rome. At the same time, he was appointed spiritual director at the Roman Minor Seminary and assistant chaplain of Regina Caeli Prison. In 1971 he left Rome to direct the diocesan Seminary of Pitigliano-Sovana-Orbetello during which time the seminary witnessed a good flourishing of priestly vocations. In 1979 he was nominated parish priest of Porto Santo Stefano. This 11 years period of pastoral mission at the Argentario was filled with spiritual blessings, according to the Vatican’s biography, and among the most enriching events was an historical visit to the parish by Mother Teresa of Calcutta with whom he developed a close friendship. He became bishop in 1990, appointed to the diocese of Massa Marittima-Piombino but due to a sudden heart ailment on March 3, 1994 he was forced to resign from his pastoral mission in the diocese which “always remained very dear to him,” the Vatican site says. As bishop emeritus of Massa Marittima-Piombino, in 1994 he became president of the Italian National Center for Vocations as well as president of the Italian National Committee for the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000. Having recovered from his illness, in 1996 he was nominated Archbishop and Pontifical Delegate for the Shrine of Loreto where he welcomed pilgrims especially the sick assisted by Unitalsi and Oftal. Pope John Paul II asked Comastri to preach the spiritual exercises to the Roman Curia in 2003 and the cardinal chose the theme “God is Love!” In 2006, Pope Benedict XVI awarded him the honor of preparing the texts for the Stations of the Cross for the Good Friday celebration at the Colosseum.

In the same year, he also said he objected to the conversion of Hagia Sophia into a mosque.1 During the pandemic, as Archpriest of St. Peter’s Basilica, Cardinal Comastri took a significant spiritual initiative to combat the global health crisis through prayer by leading a daily recitation of the Holy Rosary from St. Peter’s Basilica, which was broadcast to the faithful around the world. In 2021, Comastri became involved in a Vatican abuse trial when three witnesses testified that Cardinal Comastri or his aides were aware of sexual abuse allegations at the St. Pius X Pre-Seminary on Vatican grounds and took no action. There was confusion about whether Comastri, as archpriest of St. Peter’s Basilica and vicar general for Vatican City State, had responsibility for the pre-seminary.

He held positions such as rector of a seminary, director of an institute of theology and philosophy, and professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro. In 2010, at the young age of 43, he was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI as auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of São Sebastião do Rio de Janeiro. His leadership abilities were quickly recognized, and in 2016, Pope Francis named him Bishop of São Carlos. One of Costa’s significant achievements has been serving as the administrative director of World Youth Day in 2013, where he had the opportunity to meet Pope Francis during the pontiff’s first international trip. During his tenure as Bishop of São Carlos from 2016 to 2020, Costa made several important contributions, including creating an Ecclesiastical Tribunal, establishing a Commission for the Protection of Minors and Vulnerable Persons, and reopening the Propaedeutic Seminary. In October 2020, Pope Francis appointed Costa as the Metropolitan Archbishop of Brasilia, a position he assumed in December of that year. This appointment placed him at the center of Brazil’s political and religious landscape, as Brasilia is the country’s capital and home to the headquarters of the Episcopal Conference. On August 27, 2022, Pope Francis elevated Costa to the rank of cardinal, making him one of the youngest members of the College of Cardinals. At the time of his elevation, he was the third youngest cardinal elector, highlighting his rapid rise within the Church. As Archbishop of Brasilia, Costa has emphasized the importance of dialogue and engagement with various sectors of society, including the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of government. He has spoken out against political polarization, warning that ideology can mask people’s real problems. Costa advocates for a focus on concrete solutions rather than ideological debates, particularly in the context of Brazil’s political landscape. While Costa maintains that the Church should not be involved in party politics, he has shown a willingness to take firm stances on issues important to the Church, such as ecology and the protection of the Amazon. The cardinal is an admirer of the late Jesuit Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, a firm opponent of Benedict XVI and known for his heterodoxy. Asked what one of the priorities for the Church is today, Cardinal Cezar said, “We must be a Church of dialogue in an increasingly divided society” and cited Cardinal Martini as an example. “He was truly a man of dialogue, a model to follow. I consider his ability to engage with the city, in the broad sense of the term, exemplary. This is why his intuitions must be taken up again.” He has taken a strong stance against abortion and in defense of life from conception. In June 2024, he presided over a Mass for Life and against Abortion at the Metropolitan Cathedral of Brasília, where he highlighted “the need for a firm and peaceful defense of human life from fertilization, as taught by the Social Doctrine of the Church.”","• Theology/Ideology: Costa advocates for a Church of dialogue that seeks concrete solutions to societal issues rather than ideological debates, emphasizing the importance of engaging with diverse sectors of society.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his strong leadership abilities and commitment to fostering dialogue, which positions him as a mediator in politically polarized environments.

57,Joseph Coutts,"Cardinal Joseph Coutts is a retired Archbishop of Karachi, Pakistan, who has focused on building bridges between communities and promoting peace and understanding in a challenging environment for religious minorities. Born on July 21, 1945, in Amritsar, India, Coutts was ordained priest on January 9, 1971, in Lahore, Pakistan. The cardinal holds a doctorate in philosophy. His ecclesiastical career progressed rapidly, with several significant appointments. On May 5, 1988, he was appointed Coadjutor Bishop of Hyderabad, Pakistan, and was consecrated as bishop on September 16 of the same year. He succeeded as Bishop of Hyderabad on September 1, 1990. Coutts’ leadership qualities were further recognized when he was appointed Bishop of Faisalabad on June 27, 1998, following the death of Bishop John Joseph. His most notable appointment came on January 25, 2012, when Pope Benedict XVI named him Archbishop of Karachi, a position he held until 2021. On May 20, 2018, Pope Francis announced his elevation to the rank of cardinal. This announcement was met with great joy and celebration among both Christians and Muslims in Pakistan, as Coutts became only the second cardinal from the predominantly Muslim nation, 45 years after the first. Cardinal Coutts is known for his tireless efforts in promoting interfaith harmony, education, and social welfare in Pakistan. He has been actively involved in initiatives to encourage peaceful coexistence among people of different religions and was present for the signing of the Human Fraternity document in Abu Dhabi in 2019. In recognition of his contributions, it was announced that he would receive the “Tamgha-e-Imtiaz” award, one of Pakistan’s highest civilian honors. Throughout his career, Cardinal Coutts has been a vocal advocate for the rights of religious minorities in Pakistan. He has often spoken out against the misuse of blasphemy laws and has worked to promote understanding between different faith communities. His efforts in this regard have been widely praised, both within Pakistan and internationally. His work has consistently focused on building bridges between communities and promoting peace and understanding in a sometimes challenging environment for religious minorities. Cardinal Coutts appears to be supportive of Pope Francis’s efforts to promote synodality in the Catholic Church and fully subscribes to the concept. He described the recent Synod on Synodality as “unique” and the first time in the Catholic Church that such a broad, universal process has been undertaken. He noted that Pope Francis is “breaking away from that pyramidal Church structure” and trying to get “all the faithful involved.” Coutts acknowledged challenges to implementing synodality, especially in a context like Pakistan with high illiteracy rates and a geographically dispersed population. However, he seemed optimistic about the process, stating “we got off to a good start, but we have to continue working on it.” Coutts has expressed concern about how actions by Western countries can negatively impact Christians in Pakistan. He noted that following certain policies or events in the West, Pakistani Christians often face repercussions because some Muslims associate them with Western Christianity. He criticized the “duplicity, the hypocrisy” of the United States and European Union, arguing that their actions with respect to Muslim-majority countries have contributed to the rise of Islamic extremism as Muslims equate the two and blame the West for conflicts in Iraq, Afghanistan and other territories. Cardinal Coutts has great linguistic prowess and is fluent in several languages, including English, Italian, German, French, Urdu, Punjabi, and Sindhi.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Coutts emphasizes interfaith dialogue and the promotion of peace among diverse religious communities, aligning closely with Pope Francis's vision for a synodal Church.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is recognized for his diplomatic skills and ability to build consensus across cultural and religious lines, fostering collaboration even in challenging environments.

58,Blase Joseph Cupich,"Cardinal Blase Joseph Cupich, the current Archbishop of Chicago, is a close ally of Pope Francis but whose views and actions have been questioned for departing from orthodoxy and apostolic tradition. Born on March 19, 1949, in Omaha, Nebraska, Cupich was ordained priest for the Archdiocese of Omaha on August 16, 1975. He obtained his B.A. in Philosophy from the College of St. Thomas in St. Paul, Minnesota, in 1971. He furthered his studies at the North American College and Gregorian University in Rome, earning a Baccalaureate in Sacred Theology in 1974 and an M.A. in Theology in 1975. He later received a Licentiate of Sacred Theology in 1979 and a Doctorate of Sacred Theology in 1987 from the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. Cupich’s ecclesiastical life has been marked by several significant appointments. He served as Bishop of Rapid City, South Dakota, from 1998 to 2010, and as Bishop of Spokane, Washington from 2010 to 2014. Reputedly going over the heads of his Vatican advisers, Francis appointed Cupich Archbishop of Chicago in 2014, succeeding the late Cardinal Francis George. Cupich was elevated to the College of Cardinals on November 19, 2016. The American cardinal served as Chair for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops’ (USCCB) Committee for the Protection of Children and Young People from 2008-2011 and for the National Catholic Educational Association from 2013-2015. He has also been appointed to various influential Vatican dicasteries by Pope Francis, including the Dicastery for Bishops, the Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, and the Dicastery for Culture and Education. In 2019, he was one of four members of an organizing committee that prepared an international Vatican summit on clerical sex abuse. Cardinal Cupich has sought to promote Francis’ pastoral and synodal approaches, but how he has gone about this, along with his handling of certain issues, have drawn significant criticism and controversy. In Rapid City in 2002, he banned children from receiving their first communion and confirmation in the old rite and prohibited a Traditional Mass community from celebrating the Mass in the vetus ordo. Cupich was also one of the first bishops to issue restrictions on the Traditional Mass following the publication of Traditionis Custodes in 2021. His decree, released just after Christmas on December 27, 2021, included the prohibition of Traditional Latin Masses on the first Sunday of every month, Christmas, the Triduum, Easter Sunday, and Pentecost Sunday. One year after Benedict XVI appointed him bishop of Spokane in 2010, Cupich discouraged priests and seminarians of the diocese from demonstrating in front of Planned Parenthood clinics or supporting the 40 Days for Life anti-abortion movement.1 Cupich has also faced repeated criticism for his perceived leniency towards Catholic politicians who support abortion rights. The latest criticism came in 2024 when he delivered the invocation prayer at the Democratic National Convention despite the party’s strong promotion of abortion rights, and the organizers allowing a truck to park just outside the convention center where free abortions and vasectomies were provided. Cupich’s supporters saw it as an opportunity to bring prayer into the public sphere; pro-life activists saw it as a “incredibly disheartening” and a “missed opportunity to condemn the Democrats “vile, murderous policies.” In an unprecedented move in 2020, Cupich publicly criticized a statement by the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops on President Joe Biden’s inauguration. The statement stressed the evils of abortion, saying it was “the preeminent issue that cannot be ignored.” Biden was a staunchly pro-abortion politician who described himself as a “devout Catholic.” Cupich called the USCCB statement “ill-considered” and claimed it was issued without proper consultation. This public disagreement with fellow bishops was seen as a breach of episcopal etiquette. Cupich did, however, welcome the Dobbs decision overturning Roe v. Wade, calling it an “important ruling” that creates an opportunity for “a national conversation on protecting human life in the womb.” In 2018, the American cardinal came under fire for dismissing abuse allegations against then-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, saying the Pope “has a bigger agenda” and “we’re not going to go down a rabbit hole on this.” McCarrick was later found guilty, removed from the cardinalate and laicized. Cupich later said McCarrick “should be held accountable” and he commended a Vatican investigation into the laicized former cardinal. Cupich is a strong proponent of synodality in the Church. He sees it as “a new way of being church” that taps into Catholic tradition. He supports having lay people, including women, participate and vote in synods alongside bishops. He has called for more welcoming language toward homosexuals, saying that using terms like “gay” and “lesbian” is “a step toward respect.” Cupich also praised the Vatican’s 2023 declaration Fiducia Supplicans saying such blessings for same-sex couples was “a step forward” in pastoral accompaniment. His views contrasted with widespread opposition to the declaration across the world, especially in Africa. Cupich also views climate change as an urgent threat to humanity that the Church must address. He has called on bishops to “step forward and galvanize sentiment” on the issue. And he has expressed openness to further discussion on the possibility of women deacons in the Church, though he has not explicitly endorsed the idea. He would like to see an expanding role of women in the Church. In 2024, the cardinal caused further controversy when he issued a letter urging the faithful to stand while receiving holy Communion and not make gestures that draw attention to oneself.2 Redemptionis Sacramentum (2004) states that communicants should not be denied holy Communion because they kneel. The guideline applies to the average situation in most Catholic churches. Numbers of priests, religious and seminarians have all declined since Cardinal Cupich was appointed Archbishop of Chicago in 2014.  Between 2013 and 2023, the number of priests fell from 1,559 in to 1,269, male religious from 1,048 to 750, and women religious from 1,739 to 1,068.  “The number of seminarians studying for the priesthood in the archdiocese of Chicago has decreased significantly over the past decade. The closure of St. Joseph College Seminary in 2019 and declining numbers at Mundelein Seminary indicate that the current number is likely far lower than the 100+ seminarians of around 10 years ago. Just four priests were ordained in 2024, five in 2023, two in 2022, nine in 2021, and seven in 2020. The late Cardinal Francis George, his predecessor who was well known for fostering vocations, ordained 15 priests during his final year in 2014.”  Cardinal Cupich is reported to speak several languages including English, Italian and Spanish.","• Theology/Ideology: Cupich is aligned with Pope Francis' pastoral approach, advocating for synodality and inclusivity while facing criticism for perceived departures from traditional doctrines.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is seen as a conciliatory figure, willing to engage in dialogue and promote collaborative decision-making, even amidst significant controversy.  
• Power Base: Cupich's influence stems from his close relationship with Pope Francis and his leadership roles within the USCCB and various Vatican dicasteries.

59,Michael Czerny,"Cardinal Michael Czerny, a Czech-born Canadian Jesuit, has dedicated his life to social justice issues and is currently prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, leading Pope Francis’ defense of migrants and his focus on the environment. Born on July 18, 1946, in Brno, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic), Czerny comes from a family with Jewish roots who survived the Holocaust. His mother, a Catholic with Jewish ancestors, survived a concentration camp, while his father endured forced labor during World War II. His grandfather died in a concentration camp, and two uncles were murdered in forced labor camps. In 1948, Czerny’s family immigrated to Canada, settling in Montreal. He joined the Society of Jesus in 1963 and was ordained a priest in 1973. Czerny earned a doctorate in interdisciplinary studies from the University of Chicago in 1978. His dissertation was entitled “Feuerbach the Teacher and Marx the Prophet — An Introduction to Religion.” Throughout his career, Czerny has been deeply involved in social justice initiatives. In 1979, he co-founded the Jesuit Centre for Social Faith and Justice in Toronto, serving as its first director until 1989. Following the assassination of six Jesuits in El Salvador in 1989, Czerny volunteered to replace one of the murdered priests, directing the University of Central America’s Institute for Human Rights and assisting in negotiations to end the country’s civil war. From 1992 to 2002, Czerny worked at the Jesuit General Curia in Rome, focusing on social justice and ecology. In 2002, he founded the African Jesuit AIDS Network, providing pastoral care, education, and health services for people with HIV/AIDS in nearly 30 African countries. Czerny’s Vatican career began in 2010 when he joined the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace. In 2016, Pope Francis appointed him under-secretary of the Migrants and Refugees Section of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development. He was elevated to cardinal in October 2019 and became prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development in April 2022, succeeding Cardinal Peter Turkson whom he had advised for many years. Notable events in Czerny’s recent ecclesial career include his participation in the Synod on the Amazon in 2019 and his mission to Ukraine in March 2022, when Pope Francis sent him with humanitarian aid following the Russian invasion. Cardinal Czerny holds progressive views and overall his approach generally aligns with Pope Francis’ vision of pastoral care, mercy, and social justice. As Prefect of the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development, he strongly emphasized the importance of welcoming and protecting migrants, in line with Pope Francis’ pronouncements. The Cardinal highlighted the severe hardships faced by migrants, describing their journeys as coming “straight from hell” and facing numerous dangers, and advocating on their behalf, also on the international stage. The cardinal sees migration as an overall good, an opportunity for cultural enrichment and mutual exchange, potentially leading to “reciprocal gifts” between different cultures. Czerny connects the issue of migration with environmental concerns, asserting that many are forced to flee due to the climate crisis. He emphasizes the need to address both the “cry of the earth and the cry of the poor.” He is very vocal about the environment and has called for an ecological conversion. “Ecology” may be fashionable, he said, adding we have not grasped the gravity of the situation. The current ecological crisis is so deep, he added, “if we don’t change we won’t make it,” he said after the Amazon synod in 2019. Czerny has called for a rapid transition from a fossil-fuel economy to a clean-energy economy, with the goal of achieving zero emissions by mid-century. He promotes the concept of “eco-justice,” which focuses on concern for the poor and vulnerable in addressing environmental issues and has urged educational institutions to become catalysts for action and critical thinking about our existence in our common home Soon after the 2019 Amazon Synod the cardinal expressed continued openness to women deacons, after the participants called on the Pope to reopen a women deacons commission. The cardinal said the Church respects “different levels of authority,” adding that the issue of women deacons was “not within scope of the Synod for the Amazon” and that it must be reflected on at a different level. Cardinal Czerny has defended the unborn. In response to the 2022 Dobbs decision that overturned Roe vs. Wade, he said that “life is sacred in all its stages, and, as such, all stages of life should be protected under law” and that the “whole community needs to provide solid assistance to mothers, couples and the unborn, encouraging mothers in difficulty to see the pregnancy through and entrust the infant to reliable foster parents.” The cardinal added: “The protection and defense of human life is a matter not just of individual rights but of broad social significance. Adequate sexual education, accessible health care, affordable housing and sound legislation are needed to protect motherhood and the family and to overcome persistent inequities.” In 2022, Cardinal Czerny flew to western Canada to celebrate the funeral Mass of Bishop Remi De Roo. Cardinal Czerny paid tribute to Bishop De Roo, well known as a proponent of women’s ordination and advocate for the infamous Winnipeg Statement on Humanae Vitae. Bishop De Roo “was complex, controversial, and faithful to his convictions until the end”, Cardinal Czerny preached. “Above all he was a Council Father who dedicated the subsequent 55 years to continually rediscovering what it means to live as a Council Christian and as a Council Church … and now indeed as a Synodal Church”. Bishop De Roo “was complex, controversial, and faithful to his convictions until the end”, Cardinal Czerny preached. “Above all he was a Council Father who dedicated the subsequent 55 years to continually rediscovering what it means to live as a Council Christian and as a Council Church … and now indeed as a Synodal Church”. In February 2025, Cardinal Czerny spoke out against the Trump administration’s decision to freeze funding of much of USAID and its deportation of illegal migrants. Czerny told the Associated Press that every incoming government has the right to review its foreign aid budget, and even to reform an agency like USAID. But he said it’s another thing to dismantle an agency after it has made funding commitments. “There are programs underway and expectations and we might even say commitments, and to break commitments is a serious thing,” Czerny said. “So while every government is qualified to review its budget in the case of foreign aid, it would be good to have some warning because it takes time to find other sources of funding or to find other ways of meeting the problems we have.” USAID helped fund Catholic Relief Services, and Caritas international programs at the diocesan and national levels were also being impacted directly or indirectly by the cuts. On the decision to end USAID funding for gender ideology programs, Czerny said: “If the government thinks that its programs have been distorted by ideology, well, then they should reform the programs. Many people would say that shutting down is not the best way to reform them.” Regarding the administration’s deportation of illegal immigrants, the cardinal said: “A crackdown is a terrible way to administer affairs and much less to administer justice. And so I’m very sorry that many people are being hurt and indeed terrorized by the measures.” Cardinal Czerny speaks English, Czech, French, German, Italian, and Spanish fluently or near-fluently.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Czerny embodies a progressive theological stance, emphasizing social justice, environmental stewardship, and the protection of marginalized communities, particularly migrants.

62,Pablo Virgilio Siongco David,"Cardinal Pablo Virgilio Siongco David, the Bishop of Kalookan, Philippines, is known for his concern for social justice and outreach to the poor, his disdain for the “triumphalism” of Christendom, as well as for his outspoken criticism of former President Rodrigo Duterte. Commonly known as “Bishop Ambo,” David was born on March 2, 1959, in Betis, Guagua, Pampanga. He is the tenth of thirteen children in his family and the son of a lawyer. Cardinal David entered the Mother of Good Counsel Minor Seminary in Pampanga at the age of eleven, following a spiritual calling. He pursued higher education abroad, spending a year at the École Biblique in Jerusalem and five years at the Flemish campus of the University of Leuven in Belgium, where he earned his doctoral degree with highest honors, specializing in hermeneutics and the Old Testament. Throughout his career, David has held numerous positions within the Catholic Church. He served as a parochial vicar, lecturer, formator, and professor at various institutions. In 2006, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as Titular Bishop of Guardialfiera and Auxiliary of San Fernando. In September, 2015, Pope Francis appointed him as the Bishop of the Diocese of Kalookan. David has taken on significant leadership roles within the Catholic Church. He was elected President of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of the Philippines in 202.  In February 2024, he was elected as the next Vice President of the Federation of Bishops Conferences of Asia (FABC), with his term set to begin in 2025. Pope Francis elevated him to the cardinalate on December 7, 2024. Cardinal David is known for his efforts to bring the Church closer to marginalized communities. In Kalookan, he established 21 urban mission stations in poor areas to accompany, protect, and empower communities affected by extrajudicial killings. He is also recognized for his scholarly work in biblical studies and his ability to communicate effectively in multiple languages. David gained significant attention for his vocal opposition to former President Rodrigo Duterte’s “war on drugs.” His criticism of the government’s approach, which human rights organizations denounced for leading to thousands of extrajudicial killings, made him a target of threats. Despite these challenges, Cardinal David has remained committed to his advocacy for human rights and social justice. The Filipino cardinal offers a “Filipino and Asian perspective” on approaching people with same-sex attraction, and wishes to view all persons as human beings first rather than labeling them based on gender, sexuality, and other characteristics. He draws parallels to Jesus’ approach of socializing with all people, regardless of their reputation or status. He was supportive of Fiducia Supplicans, saying he believed it “speaks for itself” and does not require much explanation. It is, he said, “sufficient to guide the prudent and fatherly discernment of ordained ministers in this regard.”  David went on to stress that the blessing should not be confused with marriage and that it doesn’t change the Church’s doctrine on marriage. Cardinal David is a strong proponent of synodality in the Church. He views it as a way to empower others, particularly the laity, in the mission of the Church. He believes that synodality can help alleviate the burden on priests by promoting shared responsibility and collaboration. David sees synodality as a means to foster communion and participation among priests and bishops, and as a way to practice communal discernment. Throughout his career, Cardinal Pablo Virgilio Siongco David has demonstrated a commitment to social justice, scholarship, and pastoral care. He has also made several recent controversial statements against traditional Catholicism and Christendom. In a homily on December 3, 2024, at the consecration of a bishop shortly before David was elevated to the cardinalate, he suggested that the Eucharist should be given to everyone, including grave sinners, implied that Jesus gave the Eucharist to Judas as a sign of forgiveness, and described Christianity as “never meant only for the holy and deserving.” Similar to Pope Francis’ statements on the Eucharist, he said it is “not an exclusive meal for the righteous but a body broken for broken people.” David has written fairly extensively in defense of Judas, stressing that Jesus personally chose him as one of the twelve apostles1 He argued that Judas repented and attempted to return the money before taking his own life, and interpreted the phrase “Satan had entered into Judas” as a merciful explanation, suggesting Judas was not himself during the betrayal. In his December 2024 homily, David also referred to St. Mary Magdalene and other women of that time as having to “struggle with the sexist attitudes of these androcentric, patriarchal male disciples who wouldn’t trust their testimony just because they were women.” In response to criticism of his words on Judas, the cardinal said his stated purpose in trying to rehabilitate Judas was to draw attention to a “condemnatory attitude” that he believes is “very unchristian,” adding that condemning the sin of Judas and condemning Judas “are two entirely different things.” He added: “There is something terribly wrong about Christians rushing too quickly into judgment, condemning people they regard as sinners, as if they were God. It sends shivers to my spine.” In a 2020 homily, David revealed he is not in favor of the traditional reason and interpretation of the Feast of Christ the King. He criticized the tendency to portray Christ’s kingship in what he called “worldly” terms, such as building grand cathedrals and using royal symbols. He highlighted Pope Francis’ efforts to remove such “triumphalism,” choosing simpler attire and living quarters. The true meaning of Christ’s kingship, he argued, is that Jesus’ kingdom is “not of this world” but is about serving others and upending worldly power structures, and that Christ identified with the marginalized: the hungry, homeless, sick, and captives. Cardinal David has also expressed his disdain for the kingship of priests and bishops and such trappings as a bishop’s palace and “lavish vestments,” implying that they foster clericalism. “If the Pope’s and bishops acted like that then priests would surely imitate them. They would make their parishes little kingdoms,” he said. He lamented that such an approach is “being revived today – in very elaborate and lavish vestments filled with embellishments, in richly-decorated churches with retablos that seem to be totally covered in gold leaf that shout in luxury. And they make the cathedra look like a real throne.” He claimed that Satan wants to abort the work of making Jesus present in the world by “deceiving us” and “confusing us” by “instilling in us all the triumphalism, the delusion of grandeur, the desire to build an empire for Christendom.” In the past and perhaps even up to the present, he continued, “some ecclesiastical authorities, including popes and cardinals and bishops have built cathedrals looking like palaces, and seated themselves on chairs looking like thrones, wearing miters looking like crowns, trying desperately to mimic worldly kings. They think that is how we should honor Christ the king; they end up dishonoring him instead.” In another post on Facebook in October 2024, Cardinal David again stressed simplicity over grandeur, this time regarding ecclesiastical titles. He argued that such forms of address as “Your Eminence” or “Your Excellency” are outdated, and suggested using “Father,” “Bishop,” and “Cardinal” instead as they are expressions of relationship. Cardinal David is a polyglot, fluent in several languages. He speaks Kapampangan, Filipino, English, French, Flemish, German, Italian, and Spanish, and knows Latin, Greek, and Aramaic.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal David emphasizes social justice and inclusivity, advocating for a Church that serves the marginalized rather than adhering to traditional triumphalism.

63,Angelo De Donatis,"Cardinal Angelo De Donatis was a parish priest as recently as 2014 but has since rapidly risen up the ecclesiastical ranks to become a bishop, cardinal, Vicar General of Rome, and now head of the Apostolic Penitentiary. Born on January 4, 1954, in Casarano, Italy, De Donatis studied at the seminary of Taranto and then at the Pontifical Roman Major Seminary, completing his philosophical studies at the Pontifical Lateran University and his theological studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he obtained a licentiate in moral theology. He was ordained priest in 1980 for the diocese of Nardò-Gallipoli and in 1983 was incardinated in the diocese of Rome. He has held various administrative roles: clerk, archivist, director of clergy office, as well as being a spiritual director at the Roman seminary and a teacher of religion. In 1989 he was admitted to the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem with the rank of Knight. De Donatis was relatively obscure until 2013 when he was reportedly among seven Roman priests chosen by Archbishop Giovanni Angelo Becciu to dine with Pope Francis two weeks after the Pope’s election. Despite only meeting De Donatis on that occasion, Francis chose him to preach the 2014 Lenten meditations for the Spiritual Exercises of the Roman Curia. For 50 years that assignment had only been given to a cardinal or well-known theologian. In September 2015, Pope Francis appointed him auxiliary bishop of Rome where he was responsible for the training of the clergy. After just two years as a bishop, Francis then appointed De Donatis Vicar General of Rome and Archpriest of the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran. The appointment was notable as De Donatis became the first person since the sixteenth century to be named Vicar General when not a cardinal. Pope Francis elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 2018. In April 2024, Cardinal De Donatis was appointed as the Major Penitentiary, leading the Apostolic Penitentiary, a Vatican court known as the “tribunal of Mercy.” The court handles cases of excommunication and serious sin, where absolution is reserved to the Holy See, and has the right to grant indulgences. De Donatis faced several controversies during his tenure as Vicar of Rome. In March 2020, on the instruction of Pope Francis, he closed every church in Rome to the public due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A day later, after a media backlash, Pope Francis said in a morning homily that such “drastic measures aren’t always good” and he and De Donatis reversed the decision. The cardinal publicly took responsibility for both decisions, saying that the order to close churches was not made out of “an irrational fear or, worse, a pragmatism devoid of evangelical hope, but out of obedience to the will of God.” De Donatis himself was tested positive for COVID-19 later that month and was hospitalized. In 2021, Pope Francis initiated the first financial audit of the Diocese of Rome under De Donatis’ leadership, though no findings were published. Additionally, De Donatis faced criticism for questioning the Vatican’s decision to excommunicate Father Marko Rupnik, a disgraced former Jesuit artist accused of abusing women religious. Despite appointing De Donatis to various leadership positions over the past decade, Pope Francis took steps to limit his authority. In January 2023 while De Donatis was still Vicar of Rome, he downgraded the role, redefining it as an “auxiliary” position and giving himself final say over various diocesan decisions. As Vicar General, the Italian prelate took several significant steps to restrict the Traditional Latin Mass in Rome following Pope Francis’ 2021 apostolic letter Traditionis Custodes. Cardinal De Donatis stated that the measures were taken to “exercise a keen pastoral charity towards the faithful” while also implementing the directives of Traditionis Custodes. On same-sex blessings, De Donatis backed the Vatican’s declaration Fiducia Supplicans, saying it does not change Church doctrine on marriage. He stated that “people are blessed, not sin” and that the declaration’s intention is to bless people, not organizations. As Vicar of Rome, he also supported Pope Francis’ initiatives on “ecological conversion,” including the launch of a new academic program at the Pontifical Lateran University dedicated to “Care for our common home and safeguarding creation.”","• Theology/Ideology: De Donatis emphasizes a pastoral approach to theology, focusing on mercy, ecological conversion, and the dignity of individuals while adhering to traditional Church doctrine.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is seen as a conciliatory figure, willing to publicly take responsibility for controversial decisions and navigate criticism with a commitment to obedience and charity.  
• Power Base: De Donatis has built his influence through a rapid ascent within the Roman hierarchy, holding significant roles such as Vicar General of Rome and head of the Apostolic Penitentiary, despite some limitations imposed by Pope Francis.

64,Salvatore De Giorgi,"Cardinal Salvatore De Giorgi is a former Archbishop of Palermo known for his outspoken condemnation of organized crime and his sensitivity to social problems, especially those concerning family, youth, and the protection of life. He also played a key role in investigating the 2012 Vatileaks affair. Born on September 6, 1930, in Vernole, Italy, De Giorgi was ordained priest for the Diocese of Lecce on June 28, 1953, by Bishop Francesco Minerva, whom he served as secretary until 1958. De Giorgi was consecrated Auxiliary of Oria in 1973 and became Bishop of Oria on March 17, 1978. His leadership roles expanded as he was promoted to Archbishop of Foggia on April 4, 1981. Six years later he was transferred to the Metropolitan Church of Taranto. In 1990, De Giorgi was named General Chaplain of Catholic Action. In 1996 he was appointed Archbishop of Palermo and elected President of the Sicilian Episcopal Conference. His service in this role continued until his retirement on December 19, 2006. Throughout his career, De Giorgi held various positions within the Italian Episcopal Conference, including secretary of the Liturgical Commission, member of the Commission for the Doctrine of the Faith, Catechesis and Culture, and president of the Bishops’ Commission for the Laity. De Giorgi’s pastoral ministry was characterized by a focus on spiritual aspects, dedication to clergy formation, and promotion of the laity. He was also known for his sensitivity to social issues, particularly those affecting families, youth, and the protection of life. On February 21, 1998, St. John Paul II elevated De Giorgi to the rank of Cardinal, assigning him the title of S. Maria in Ara Coeli. He participated in the conclave of April 2005, which elected Pope Benedict XVI. Beyond his ecclesiastical duties, De Giorgi is also a journalist-publicist and author of several publications on religious topics. His works include “Le meraviglie del Regno” and “Riscopriamo la nostra ministerialità.” Cardinal Salvatore De Giorgi’s life and career exemplify dedicated service to the Catholic Church, spanning over six decades and encompassing various influential roles within the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Cardinal Salvatore De Giorgi played a significant role in the Vatileaks investigation as one of the three cardinals appointed by Pope Benedict XVI to investigate the scandal. As part of this commission, De Giorgi, along with Cardinal Julián Herranz and Cardinal Jozef Tomko, was tasked with conducting a thorough internal investigation that went beyond the narrow criminal scope of the leaks.1 Cardinal De Giorgi is known for his dedication to the formation of clergy, and promotion of the laity. According to his Vatican biography, he is also “sensitive to the social problems regarding the family, the young and the protection of life,” and has “always been attentive to the diverse realities tied to the disadvantage and to the emarginated by visiting hospitals, prisons, drug rehabilitation centers, immigration centers, facilities assisting the handicapped.” He was also often outspoken in his condemnation of organized crime and the mafia when he was Archbishop of Palermo.","• Theology/Ideology: De Giorgi emphasizes a pastoral approach that prioritizes social justice, family issues, and the sanctity of life.

65,Jozef De Kesel,"Cardinal Jozef De Kesel is a Belgian prelate and former Metropolitan Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels well known for his liberal views on social issues that closely ally with those of Pope Francis. Born on June 17, 1947, in Ghent, East Flanders, he was ordained as a priest on August 26, 1972, for the diocese of Ghent. De Kesel’s academic achievements include obtaining a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, with a dissertation on Rudolf Bultmann’s theology. Throughout his career, De Kesel has held several significant positions within the Catholic Church. He served as an auxiliary bishop of Mechelen-Brussel from 2002 to 2010, during which time he also acted as vicar general for the Vicariate of Brussels. In 2010, he was appointed as the bishop of Brugge. His most notable appointment came on November 6, 2015, when Pope Francis named him the Metropolitan Archbishop of Mechelen-Brussels and Military Ordinary for Belgium. De Kesel’s influence extended beyond his archdiocese when he became the president of the Episcopal Conference of Belgium in January 2016. His prominence in the Church was further solidified when Pope Francis created and proclaimed him cardinal in the consistory of November 19, 2016, with the titular church of Santi Giovanni e Paolo. As a scholar and religious leader, De Kesel has contributed to theological discourse through numerous articles and a book on the Church and various aspects of Christian life. He has also served as a lecturer at the seminary of Ghent, a training center for future religion teachers, and the progressive University of Leuven. However, De Kesel’s tenure has not been without controversy. He has faced criticism for his handling of sexual abuse allegations within the Church. As a local bishop, he drew scrutiny for his management of five separate sexual abuse cases. Like many of his fellow bishops from the Low Countries, he holds views inconsistent with the Church’s perennial Magisterium. In 2015, he told a television reporter that he respected homosexuals and the way they live their sexuality. In 2010, he voiced support for women’s ordination to the priesthood, saying it was “negotiable,” but subsequently backtracked. He also said that priestly celibacy should be optional as for some people it may not be “humanly possible.” In October 2024 in a speech in Bologna, Cardinal De Kesel presented a vision of the Church that critics argued deviated from traditional Catholic teachings. In his talk, he said he viewed secularization as a positive development, arguing that it allows for a more authentic faith by removing social pressure to believe. He also criticized what he called an “integralist” vision of Catholicism, which he believed was outdated and incompatible with modern society. Critics argued that his approach risked diluting the Church’s mission and compromising its core beliefs, and that if widely adopted, could negatively lead to a fundamental change in the Catholic Church’s role in society and its understanding of its own mission. De Kesel has also attracted opposition from Catholics attached to the Vetus Ordo by surprisingly closing down the “Fraternity of the Holy Apostles,” a flourishing priestly association in the archdiocese supported by his predecessor, Archbishop André-Joseph Leonard. Despite his progressive views, in a 2024 interview he declared that the Church will not draw people to God focusing just on migration or ecology and that the “aggiornamento” of the Second Vatican Council should be interpreted not as an adaptation to the world, but as openness towards it. Amid these challenges, sympathetic progressive media have described De Kesel as a man of extraordinary freedom, advocating dialogue between the Church and society. He has positioned himself as a key papal ally in Europe, aligning with Pope Francis’s vision for the Church. On June 22, 2023, Pope Francis accepted De Kesel’s resignation from the pastoral care of the archdiocese of Mechelen-Brussel, marking the end of his tenure as archbishop. Cardinal De Kesel is multilingual, proficient in French, Dutch, English, and Italian.","• Theology/Ideology: De Kesel advocates for a liberal approach to theology, aligning closely with Pope Francis on social issues and promoting a vision of the Church that embraces secularization as a means to authentic faith.

66,John Atcherley Dew,"Cardinal John Atcherley Dew is a former Archbishop of Wellington, New Zealand, who was one of the first cardinals to controversially push for ending the prohibition on civilly remarried divorcees receiving Holy Communion. Born on May 5, 1948, in Waipawa, New Zealand, Dew began his religious journey by studying philosophy at the Holy Name Seminary and theology at Holy Cross College, leading to his ordination as a priest on May 9, 1976. Dew’s early ministry included serving as an assistant priest in St Joseph’s Parish, Upper Hutt, from 1976 to 1979. He then spent two years in the Cook Islands, working as a missionary in the Maori community in the Diocese of Rarotonga from 1980 to 1982. Upon returning to Wellington, he took responsibility for the Archdiocesan Youth Ministry and the Cook Islands Māori Community from 1983 to 1987. In 1988 he was appointed director of formation at Holy Cross College in Mosgiel, during which time he reportedly expressed concern about the unsuitability of many students.1 From 1991-1993 he studied spirituality at the Institute of St. Anselm in Kent, England.  Upon earning a diploma, he stayed in England and began serving as parish priest in Newtown. In 1995, Dew was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Wellington Archdiocese. His ascent in the Church hierarchy continued when Pope John Paul II appointed him Coadjutor Archbishop of Wellington in 2004. In 2005 he took over as the sixth Catholic Archbishop of Wellington and the Metropolitan of New Zealand, a position he held until 2023. That same year, he was also appointed bishop of New Zealand’s military ordinariate. Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as a Synod father for the 2012 Synod on Evangelization, and he was appointed a Synod father and relator of one of the English language groups for the first Synod on the Family in 2014. Pope Francis elevated Dew to the cardinalate on February 14, 2015, with the title of Cardinal-Priest of Sant’Ippolito. This appointment made him the fourth cardinal in the history of New Zealand. Dew has held several significant positions within the Church, including President of the New Zealand Catholic Bishops’ Conference and President of the Federation of Catholic Bishops’ Conferences of Oceania (FCBCO). One of the most notable events in Dew’s career was his intervention at the 2005 Synod on the Eucharist. He proposed that divorced and remarried Catholics and Christians married to Catholics should be allowed to receive the Eucharist, describing the existing ban as a “scandal.”2 Pope Francis’ attempt to change the Church’s pastoral approach on the issue in his apostolic exhortation Amoris Laetitia drew significant opposition and controversy. Cardinal Dew has shown a certain disregard for Church laws that seek to prevent the sin and scandal of sacrilegious reception of the Eucharist by those who lack the proper disposition because they have civilly remarried after divorce. He has argued for Church documents to be less “judging and condemning, passing out rules and laws” and favors instead adopting a new approach that shows “concern and compassion,” giving people “hope and support and encouragement,” and using “language that helps people and encourages people in their journey to God.” A 2018 New Zealand survey showed a sharp decline in the number of Christian believers in the country, and the main reason given was reportedly the Church’s teaching on homosexuality and the doctrine on Hell. Rather than bolster the Church’s teaching in these areas, Dew said Church leaders had fallen short with regards to inclusion of particular groups in society, “such as the LGBT community, who have felt a very real sense of rejection through the Church, or perhaps in falling short in fully meeting the needs of our recent migrant communities.” Similar to Pope Francis, he has urged the faithful to be “radical” in their thinking and to let go of the “established order” of doing things. He has been accused of being “autocratic and too progressive,” but he ignores such criticism, saying such critics “don’t fully grasp that the Church is here to be at the service of the world, not just to be looking inwards.” Regarding church buildings, Dew is in favor of repurposing the buildings, not for worship, but turning them  into soup kitchens, or opened up to the homeless, refugees or the elderly. “I get anxious that we are not using what we have to its fullest potential,” he has said. “We need to ask how do we continue to involve people, and inspire people.” Dew, who supports synodality, has said: “When Church teaching is explained in such a way that it says to people they’re intrinsically disordered or they’re living an evil life, people feel they can’t meet the mark rather than it being something helping, supportive and encouraging.” In 2023, Dew faced allegations of historical sexual abuse dating back to the 1970s. He immediately stepped aside from all public Church activities while investigations were conducted. Both the New Zealand police and a Vatican-led review concluded that no further action was required, and Dew was cleared to resume his public Church activities. Throughout this process, Dew consistently denied the allegations, emphasizing his commitment to his episcopal motto, “Peace through integrity.”","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Dew advocates for a more inclusive and compassionate approach to Church teachings, particularly concerning divorced and remarried Catholics.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is seen as both progressive and autocratic, willing to disregard traditional Church laws in favor of a more radical, service-oriented mindset.  
• Power Base: As a former Archbishop of Wellington and a prominent figure within the New Zealand Catholic Bishops’ Conference, Dew holds significant influence in regional Church affairs.

67,Daniel Nicholas DiNardo,"Cardinal Daniel Nicholas DiNardo, Archbishop Emeritus of Galveston-Houston, is a conservative-leaning former president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops who has spoken out strongly in favor of life and for the rights of migrants and refugees. Born on May 23, 1949, in Steubenville, Ohio, he was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Pittsburgh on July 16, 1977, after completing his education at various institutions, including the Catholic University of America, the Pontifical Gregorian University, and the Patristic Institute Augustinianum. DiNardo’s ecclesiastical career has been marked by several significant appointments and achievements. He served in various roles in the Diocese of Pittsburgh before working in Rome from 1984 to 1991 as a staff member for the Congregation for Bishops and as director of Villa Stritch, the residence for American clergy living in Rome. In 1997, he was appointed coadjutor bishop of Sioux City, Iowa, and became the bishop of Sioux City in 1998. In 2004, DiNardo was named coadjutor bishop (later archbishop) of Galveston-Houston, succeeding Archbishop Joseph Fiorenza in 2006. He was elevated to the College of Cardinals by Pope Benedict XVI in 2007, becoming the first cardinal from a diocese in the Southern United States. DiNardo participated as a cardinal-elector in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis. DiNardo has held several leadership positions within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). He served as vice president from 2013 to 2016 and as president from 2016 to 2019. The American cardinal has faced accusations of mishandling sexual abuse allegations within his archdiocese: these related to two episodes of sexual abuse by a priest in the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston in 2018. In 2019, he was accused of mishandling an allegation of sexual coercion made against his former vicar general, Msgr. Frank Rossi. In November 2018, CBS News reported that they had spoken to 20 people claiming knowledge of misconduct incidents, none of whom had been contacted by the archdiocese, despite DiNardo’s promise to release a list of accused priests. However, DiNardo took steps to address the accusations. As well as calling for more transparency in the Church’s handling of such allegations, in January 2019 he released a list of names of 40 priests from the archdiocese with credible allegations of sexual misconduct over the previous 70 years. DiNardo was criticized for allowing a priest named John Keller, who was on the list of credibly accused priests, to offer Mass publicly at his parish the day after the list was released. The cardinal said he “was already scheduled to celebrate” it. As president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) from 2016 to 2019, DiNardo also faced challenges forced upon him related to the sexual abuse crisis. In 2018, he had to postpone a vote on measures to combat sexual abuse due to instructions from the Vatican, which was seen as a setback in addressing the crisis and an unprecedented interference from the Vatican in such an episcopal meeting. DiNardo’s positions on various issues have sometimes aligned with and sometimes diverged from those of Pope Francis. He supports the unrestricted right to life, including stricter laws on abortion. Cardinal DiNardo considers abortion to be the preeminent priority for the U.S. Catholic bishops and welcomed the overturning of Roe v. Wade, calling it a “positive” and “necessary step” towards protecting life. On migrant issues, DiNardo aligns with the Pope in favoring more protection and accepting refugees. He is less in agreement with the Pope on climate issues, seeing them as an important but not urgent. As a participant in the 2015 Synod on the Family, DiNardo was one of 13 cardinals who wrote a letter to Pope Francis ahead of the meeting warning that if the synod focused too heavily on the issue of Communion for divorced and remarried Catholics, it could raise fundamental questions about the Church’s interpretation and application of doctrine. They also cautioned against abandoning key elements of Christian belief and practice in the name of pastoral adaptation, citing the collapse of liberal Protestant churches as a warning. In November 2023, Cardinal Daniel DiNardo played a significant role in communicating Bishop Joseph Strickland’s controversial removal from the Diocese of Tyler, Texas, and providing some context for the Pope’s decision. On January 20, 2025, Pope Francis accepted Cardinal DiNardo’s resignation from the Archdiocese of Galveston-Houston, appointing as his successor Bishop Joe Steve Vásquez of Austin, who served as apostolic administrator of Tyler since Bishop Strickland’s removal from the diocese.","• Theology/Ideology: DiNardo is a conservative theologian who prioritizes the right to life and supports stricter abortion laws, viewing these as essential to his episcopal duties.

Il Cardinale Virgilio do Carmo da Silva ha svolto un ruolo importante durante la visita di Papa Francesco a Timor Est nel settembre 2024. Ha svolto il ruolo di rappresentante chiave della Chiesa cattolica di Timor-Leste durante la visita papale, fornendo un contesto, un’interpretazione e una guida spirituale per tutta la durata della visita. Ha descritto la visita papale come “un evento storico” e “una celebrazione per il popolo di Timor, una celebrazione della fede della Chiesa cattolica a Timor”.

69,Timothy Michael Dolan,"Cardinal Timothy Michael Dolan, the current Archbishop of New York, is a former president of the US Conference of Catholic Bishops known for his charismatic media personality and conservative values. Born on February 6, 1950, and the eldest of five children, his journey in the Catholic Church began at a young age when he entered Saint Louis Preparatory Seminary in 1964. He earned a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy from Cardinal Glennon College in Shrewsbury, Missouri, and later obtained a Licentiate of Sacred Theology from the Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome. He also holds a doctorate in American Church History from the Catholic University of America. Timothy Dolan was ordained a priest in 1976, completed doctoral studies (on the late Archbishop Edwin O’Hara, a founder of the Catholic Biblical Association) at the Catholic University of America and returned to Missouri to complete pastoral work from 1983 to 1987. Dolan’s ecclesial career has been marked by several significant appointments. After his ordination in 1976, he served as an associate pastor in Richmond Heights, Missouri. He then held positions as secretary of the Apostolic Nunciature in Washington, D.C., and vice-rector of Kenrick-Glennon Seminary. From 1994 to 2001, Dolan served as rector of the Pontifical North American College (PNAC) in Rome, where he also taught at the Pontifical Gregorian University and the Angelicum. John Paul II gave him the title Monsignor in 1994 while he served at the PNAC where, by all accounts, Dolan was a popular rector. In 2001, he was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of St. Louis by Pope John Paul II. On being appointed bishop, he took the episcopal motto St. Peter’s profession of faith: Ad Quem Ibimus, “Lord To Whom Shall We Go?” (Jn 6:68). Dolan’s rise in the Church hierarchy continued with his appointment as Archbishop of Milwaukee in 2002, where he faced the challenge of rebuilding trust after a series of scandals. The diocese had thousands of abuse cases and it later emerged that he oversaw payments of up to $20,000 to “more than a handful” of accused priests so they did not contest laicization. The idea was to speed up processes and incur less cost. Dolan also took a special interest in vocations in Milwaukee and the number of seminary enrolments rose during his tenure. In 2009, he was named Archbishop of New York, one of the most prominent positions in the American Catholic Church with a flock of 2.5 million Catholics. Soon after arriving in New York, Dolan undertook a reorganization of schools in the archdiocese but also announced that dozens of under-utilized schools and parishes would close or merge due to demographic changes, higher costs, declining attendance, and a fall in vocations. This drew some strong opposition with some accusations that the process was carried out in secrecy and that it caused confusion. In rare cases, appeals to the Vatican were successful in overturning closure decrees. From 2010 to 2013, Dolan served as president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. In 2012, he was elevated to the rank of cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI, participating in the conclave that elected Pope Francis in 2013. Dolan has also served as chairman of Catholic Relief Services, is a member of the Board of Trustees of the Catholic University of America, and in 2009 was the apostolic visitor to Irish seminaries as part of the apostolic visitation to Ireland that took place in light of the sexual abuse crisis there. His report on the Pontifical Irish College in Rome led to radical personnel changes to the institution. The cardinal, who is generally seen as orthodox and conservative, has been a relative moderate as archbishop of New York and often likes to teach the faith in a folksy, down-to-earth way and making use of social media to do so. The cardinal is regularly asked to appear on prime-time American television shows to discuss the faith. Known for his jovial nature and self-deprecating humor, this has made him well-liked among his peers. However, this same characteristic has led some to question whether he has the gravitas required for higher positions in the Church. And although his ecclesiastical career has had a string of high-ranking achievements, he has also become embroiled in some controversies that have attracted headlines. These have included his refusal in 2014 to allow the diocese of Peoria to receive the remains of Archbishop Fulton Sheen whose body is entombed in St. Patrick’s Cathedral. In 2018, he said he “didn’t see anything really sacrilegious” about that year’s Met Gala in New York which was widely criticized for disrespecting Catholicism, and joked that he had lent a bejeweled mitre to the singer Rihanna. Dolan also attracted controversy when he congratulated a homosexual footballer for disclosing his orientation, telling him “Bravo,” “God bless ya,” and “good for him.” He said the Bible teaches against judging people.1 In 2015, he also drew headlines when he agreed to be grand marshal of that year’s St. Patrick’s Day parade in New York when homosexual groups were allowed to take part for the first time. Dolan will, however, often defend the Church’s teaching and especially moral issues concerning life. In 2009 he signed an ecumenical declaration urging non-compliance with rules and laws permitting abortion, same-sex “marriage” and other matters that go against their religious consciences. Politically, he has also been praised for taking stands in defense of the Church and the Church’s teaching, for example during a controversy over funding of contraceptives and abortion under the Obama administration. He has further been willing to defend the Church’s teaching from within the Church: In 2015, along with 12 other cardinals, he signed an open letter to Pope Francis critical of the Synod on the Family and that it could lead to the Church falling apart in the same way as liberal Protestant denominations. During the Covid crisis, Dolan argued for the closure of churches if they experienced a rise in cases or protocols weren’t being properly followed. However, he did allow churches to stay open in some cases so that the faithful could visit them to pray. He also oversaw a ruling that priests of the archdiocese were not to issue a religious exemption to the Covid vaccines. In 2024, Cardinal Dolan directed his cathedral (St. Patrick’s in Midtown Manhattan) to offer a Mass of Reparation following the controversial funeral service for a transgender activist called Cecilia Gentili. Dolan defended the priests at the cathedral, stating that they “knew nothing about this that was coming up” regarding the background of the deceased.2 He praised the cathedral’s officiants for curtailing the funeral when they realized the nature of the gathering. However, the cardinal was criticized for his response, with some feeling that he was dismissive of faithful Catholics’ concerns.3 The cardinal is said to be popular with his clergy but under his watch, the number of priests in the archdiocese of New York has fallen from 1,783 in 2009 to 1,224 in 2021. Over the same period, the numbers of male religious have dropped from 1,340 to 855, and female religious from 2,840 to 1908. Despite his general popularity, Dolan’s chances of becoming pope have been considered slim, partly due to the concern that an American pope might upset the global balance of power.  Nonetheless, his tenure as Archbishop of New York and his role in addressing various challenges facing the Church have solidified his position as a significant and popular figure in American Catholicism. Cardinal Dolan speaks English, Italian and some Spanish.","• Theology/Ideology: Dolan is known for his orthodox and conservative values, often defending traditional Church teachings on moral issues.  
• Personality/Negotiation: His jovial nature and self-deprecating humor have made him well-liked, though some question whether he possesses the necessary gravitas for higher positions.  
• Power Base: As the Archbishop of New York, he leads a prominent archdiocese with a large flock, enhancing his influence within the American Catholic Church.  
• Core Motivation: Dolan is driven by a commitment to uphold Church teachings and foster vocations, despite facing significant challenges within the Church.","Cardinal Timothy Michael Dolan, the Archbishop of New York, is recognized for his steadfast commitment to traditional Church teachings and his efforts to promote vocations within the Catholic community.

70,Luis Pascual Dri,"Cardinal Luis Pascual Dri was born on April 17, 1927, in Federación, Entre Ríos Province, Argentina. Growing up in a family where most children consecrated themselves to religious life, Dri worked in the fields from a young age, tending animals and planting crops. At the age of 11, Dri entered the Capuchin Seminary in January 1938, completing his primary and secondary studies there. He joined the novitiate in Montevideo, Uruguay, and took the Capuchin habit on February 21, 1945. After making his perpetual profession in 1949, Dri was ordained a priest on March 29, 1952, in the Cathedral of Montevideo. Throughout his career, Dri held various positions within the Church. He served as director of seminaries, including the San Francisco de Carrasco Minor Seminary in 1953 and the Seraphic Seminary in Villa Gdor, Galvez, Argentina, in 1955. He also worked as a master of novices and specialized in Europe as a formator of novices in 1961. Dri’s ministry included roles as an educator at the Colegio y Liceo Secco Illa de Uruguay from 1962 to 1974 and as a parish priest in several locations, including Empalme, Colonia Nicolich, and Mar del Plata. In 2000, he was appointed parish priest at the Shrine of Nuestra Señora De Pompeya in Buenos Aires for three years. In 2007, at the age of 80, Dri returned to the Shrine of Nuestra Señora de Pompeya, where he has since devoted himself to hearing confessions for several hours each day. His dedication to the sacrament of reconciliation has earned him recognition from Pope Francis, who has spoken of Dri’s work as a confessor on multiple occasions. Notably, Dri had the opportunity to meet Padre Pio personally and even had him as his confessor in 1960 when they lived in the same convent. Dri cites Padre Pio and Leopold Mandić as his models and mentors. On September 30, 2023, at the age of 96, Luis Pascual Dri was made a cardinal by Pope Francis, receiving the title of Cardinal Deacon of Sant’Angelo in Pescheria. Due to his health and age, Dri did not attend the consistory in Rome but received his cardinal’s regalia on October 11 from Archbishop Mirosław Adamczyk, Apostolic Nuncio to Argentina, during a ceremony in the cathedral of Buenos Aires. Today, Cardinal Dri continues his ministry as a confessor at the Shrine of Our Lady of Pompei in Buenos Aires, where he spends hours each day administering the sacrament of reconciliation, embodying the merciful face of the Church.","• Theology/Ideology: Dri emphasizes the importance of the sacrament of reconciliation, reflecting a pastoral approach that prioritizes mercy and forgiveness.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is recognized for his dedication and humility, engaging deeply with individuals through personal confession and spiritual guidance.

71,Dominik Jaroslav Duka,"The son of a soldier, Cardinal Dominik Jaroslav Duka grew up in Bohemia, now incorporated into the Czech Republic, under the harsh policies of communism. During the brief “Prague Spring” of 1968, he entered the Dominican Order and was given the name Dominik. After his ordination to the priesthood in 1970, he defied laws of religious suppression and wore his habit in public. Despite persecution, he worked as an underground priest and novice master and as a designer in an automobile factory until he was arrested in 1981 for offering Mass illegally and publishing uncensored books. While in prison for fifteen months, he shared his cell with Václav Havel, the playwright and eventual president of Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic, and celebrated Mass under the ruse of a chess tournament.1 In 1986, he was superior of the Dominican Province, and in 1998 received episcopal ordination. In 1989, the Velvet Revolution, led by Havel and aided by Duka, peacefully dissolved communism in Czechoslovakia. After that, the Dominican friar increasingly served as a visible leader nationally and internationally — for example, as vice president of the Union of European Conferences of Major Superiors from 1992 to 1996. In 2000, he became Catholic primate of the Czech Republic; and from 2000 to 2004, he was vice president of the Czech Bishops’ Conference. Since then, he has served as a bridge between the Holy See and his native country, helping to facilitate the return of Church property previously stolen by the communist government. In 2010, Benedict XVI appointed him archbishop of Prague and, in 2012, elevated him to the College of Cardinals. As a biblical scholar, he has served on a number of theological faculties, commissions, and boards. Pope Francis accepted his resignation as Archbishop of Prague on May 13, 2022, at the age of 79. Dominik Jaroslav Duka is considered orthodox and pro-life but not rule-focused, someone with a down-to-earth faith who believes the Church must dialogue with society. He has expressed appreciation for traditional liturgy (vetus ordo) and also welcomes developments in the novus ordo; he is open to different liturgies and rites but is against meticulous observation of rubrics. He favors finding a new language for the Church to relate to today’s world, and places a premium on education. Cardinal Duka has called for greater lay involvement in the Church, especially of women, and prefers pastoralism and evangelization rather than statements and resolutions. He has cultivated close relations with the Czech political class, partly due to his dedication to restitution of Church property confiscated by the communists. This has led some to see him as too political — excessively allied to the country’s presidents and readily aligning the Church with the Czech nation. Others argue that he handles matters of state with acuity and prudence, using his influential position to serve the gospel and educate a predominantly atheist nation in the Faith. He frequently upholds the importance of the family as society’s foundation. Cardinal Duka said he understood the motives of the dubia cardinals but did not explicitly support or reject their initiative. However, in 2023, on behalf of the Czech Bishops’ Conference, he issued a dubia seeking clarification on Amoris Laetitia and its teaching on Communion for civilly remarried divorcees. He is against changing priestly celibacy, is a proponent of traditional morality, and has often condemned abortion. He firmly opposes euthanasia and same-sex “marriage” and has nuanced views on refugees and migrants. He does not see the Church as a replacement for political parties or the media but does see the Church’s role as saving man from temporal suffering and destitution as well as being an instrument of eternal salvation. Despite retiring as archbishop in 2022, the cardinal has continued to speak out with characteristic frankness that has occasionally drawn controversy. In 2024, he criticized the Holy See’s approach to communist China and its silence in the face of human rights abuses there, and censured the Olympic Games in Paris, comparing them to the games in Berlin in 1936 and Moscow in 1980 when “athletes were used for other purposes.” In 2023, he drew the ire of Jewish leaders when he said Catholics and Jews in the West face the same pressure as under Nazism due to secular ideologies. As a cardinal who suffered economic deprivation under communist state control, but later rose to the challenge of leading his flock through a time of transition and prevalent atheism, Cardinal Duka would bring a dose of realism to the papacy. Cardinal Duka is known to speak several languages including Czech, German, Italian, and English.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Duka holds orthodox views, advocating for traditional morality while also supporting pastoral engagement and lay involvement in the Church.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is characterized by a pragmatic approach to complex issues, adept at balancing theological principles with societal needs and political realities.  
• Power Base: Duka has cultivated strong relationships with the Czech political class, leveraging his position to advocate for Church interests and facilitate property restitution.  
• Core Motivation: His primary motivation lies in educating a largely atheist society about the faith while upholding the importance of family as the foundation of society.","Cardinal Dominik Jaroslav Duka is recognized for his commitment to traditional morality and pastoral engagement, emphasizing the importance of lay involvement within the Church.

72,Stanisław Dziwisz,"Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz, Pope St. John Paul II’s former long serving personal secretary and Archbishop Emeritus of Krakow, remains an influential figure in the Church, especially in his native Poland, and noted for his work in interfaith relations. In his later years Dziwisz was accused of involvement in a number of alleged scandals, all of which he denies. The Vatican cleared him of mishandling abuse cases as Archbishop of Krakow. Born on April 27, 1939, in Raba Wyżna, Poland, he was ordained as a priest on June 23, 1963, by then-Auxiliary Bishop of Krakow, Karol Wojtyła, who would later become Pope John Paul II. Dziwisz’s ecclesiastical career began with his appointment as a parochial vicar. In October 1966, Archbishop Wojtyła named him as his chaplain and secretary, marking the beginning of a long and influential relationship. When Wojtyła was elected Pope in 1978, Dziwisz became his personal secretary, a position he held throughout John Paul II’s 27-year pontificate. Throughout his career, Dziwisz continued his theological studies, earning a licentiate in theology in 1967 and a doctorate in 1981 from the Faculty of Theology of Krakow. He also served as a professor of liturgy at the Superior Catechetical Institute in Krakow and held various positions within the archdiocese. On February 7, 1998, Dziwisz was appointed titular Bishop of San Leone and Adjunct Prefect of the Pontifical Household. He was consecrated as a bishop by John Paul II on March 19, 1998. His ecclesiastical rank was further elevated when he was appointed titular Archbishop of San Leone on September 29, 2003. Following the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005, Dziwisz’s career took a significant turn when Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as the Metropolitan Archbishop of Krakow. The appointment was followed by his elevation to the rank of cardinal on March 24, 2006, with the title of Cardinal-Priest of Santa Maria del Popolo. As Archbishop of Krakow, Dziwisz played a crucial role in the “fast-tracking” of John Paul II’s beatification process after he initiated the diocesan inquiry into his heroic virtues on November 4, 2005. Dziwisz participated in the conclave of March 2013, which elected Pope Francis. He initially appeared critical of Benedict XVI’s resignation, saying: “You don’t step down from Christ’s cross,” but later said he accepted Benedict’s decision with “great respect and emotion” and that he understood the reasons for the Holy Father’s choice. His tenure as Archbishop of Krakow concluded on December 8, 2016, when Pope Francis accepted his resignation upon reaching the age limit. Throughout his career, Dziwisz has been recognized for his contributions to interfaith relations. Cardinal Dziwisz has been associated with several notable controversies and scandals, all of which he denies. In 2020, Dziwisz was accused of receiving large sums of money from the Legion of Christ. He allegedly accepted up to $50,000 for allowing wealthy donors access to papal masses at the Apostolic Palace, a practice described as an “elegant way of giving bribes.” In the same year, an investigation by Polish broadcaster TVN24 accused Dziwisz of ignoring cases of sexual abuse in the Catholic ChurchPolish priest, Father Tadeusz Isakowicz-Zaleski, claimed he personally handed documents detailing abuse cases to Dziwisz in 2012, but Dziwisz denied receiving them. This led to calls for an independent commission to investigate the matter. In April 2022, a Vatican investigation cleared Dziwisz of wrongdoing regarding his handling of sex abuse claims during his time as Archbishop of Krakow (2005-2016). The investigation did not cover his tenure as John Paul II’s secretary at the Vatican, however. Dziwisz was also implicated in the case of Theodore McCarrick, a former cardinal accused of sexual abuse. It was alleged that Dziwisz received envelopes containing thousands of dollars from McCarrick. The Vatican report on McCarrick raised questions about Dziwisz’s role in McCarrick’s appointment as Archbishop of Washington, D.C., despite evidence of McCarrick’s sexual misconduct. Dziwisz has consistently maintained his innocence and welcomed investigations into the allegations against him. He stated, “I think that the Polish society has never believed these accusations” and expressed relief that the accusations cannot be used to impugn the legacy of Pope John Paul II. He also acknowledged the pain caused by the abuse allegations, stating, “I assure everyone of my remembrance in prayer” and expressing hope that the Vatican’s decision to clear him of wrongdoing would help restore peace of mind to those affected by the accusations.","• Theology/Ideology: Dziwisz is deeply influenced by the teachings of Pope John Paul II and emphasizes interfaith dialogue as a core aspect of his theological approach.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his loyalty and dedication, Dziwisz has demonstrated resilience in navigating controversies while maintaining strong relationships within the Church hierarchy.  
• Power Base: Dziwisz commands significant influence in Poland, bolstered by his long-standing association with Pope John Paul II and his role as a former archbishop of Krakow.  
• Core Motivation: His primary motivation appears to be the preservation and promotion of John Paul II's legacy, alongside a commitment to fostering unity within the Church and addressing issues of abuse transparently.","Cardinal Stanisław Dziwisz, influenced by the teachings of Pope John Paul II, emphasizes interfaith dialogue as a vital component of his theological approach while being known for his loyalty and resilience in navigating Church controversies.

73,Willem Jacobus Eijk,"Cardinal Willem Eijk’s reputed ability to bridge diverse ways of thought comes in part from his childhood, having been raised by a Protestant father and a Catholic mother. He completed initial medical studies in 1978 at the University of Amsterdam and immediately entered the major seminary while focusing on medical ethics at the University of Leiden and working as a physician of internal medicine. In 1985, he was ordained a priest and, while serving as a chaplain, obtained a doctorate in medicine, with a thesis that responded to Dutch euthanasia practices. In 1990, Eijk was sent by his bishop to Rome, where he obtained a license in moral theology and a doctorate in philosophy at the University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum). He also earned a degree in theology from the Lateran University. Subsequently, Eijk taught moral theology in the Netherlands and in Switzerland; he also cofounded an association that promotes medical ethics, and he served on the International Theological Commission (1997-2000). In 1999, Eijk was ordained a bishop by Bishop Franciscus Wiertz of Roermond and served the Diocese of Groningen-Leeuwarden for seven years as ordinary. Much of Eijk’s work as a bishop has been in response to the increasing secularization and loss of faith in Dutch society — stressful work that possibly affected his health. In 2001, he suffered a subdural hematoma (cerebral hemorrhage); after a period of rest, he recovered and resumed his duties. Benedict XVI appointed Eijk the metropolitan archbishop of Utrecht in 2007. In the midst of his episcopal duties, Eijk coedited a manual of Catholic medical ethics, published in 2010, and was elected president of the Netherlands’ Episcopal Conference the following year. He has served as an esteemed member of the Pontifical Academy for Life and was reelected a member in 2017. In 2012, Benedict XVI created Eijk a cardinal-priest. After the Second Vatican Council, the Dutch Church was one of the most radicalized; it is now in a free fall of secularization and parish closures. In the midst of that difficult situation, Cardinal Willem Eijk has worked to bring the light of Christ to his people and the world. Eijk himself supports the Council, believes it was needed and was a work of the Holy Spirit. Vocations in the archdiocese of Utrecht initially continued their freefall after he took up his role as archbishop, but for the last decade the numbers have remained stable, despite the strong secularist headwinds throughout the Netherlands.  He is widely seen as solidly orthodox and pro-life, and has a marked devotion to Our Lady. His apostolic initiatives have focused on reviving love of the Eucharist and the Blessed Virgin Mary, family catechesis, and personal evangelization. Eijk’s experience as a physician and a moral theologian has given him tools to address cutting-edge issues that have life-or-death consequences, especially euthanasia and in vitro fertilization. Although he has had the unpleasant task of closing many parishes in Holland, an undertaking that has attracted considerable criticism from all quarters, he has done so primarily at the request of the local Church itself and in dialogue with those affected by these decisions. He has not been deterred by the unpopularity that such actions have brought him. Clear and uncompromising when it comes to the Church’s teachings, Eijk manifests a love of Catholic truth even when it is unpopular, as seen in his willingness to defend Humanae Vitae and to uphold the indissolubility of marriage as only between one man and one woman and the privileged place for the conjugal act. He has also opposed same-sex blessings, but with characteristic tact and diplomacy. His insistence on Christ’s teaching regarding an all-male, celibate priesthood has been a sign of contradiction for some. While having compassion on refugees and emphasizing the need to care for them, especially for Christians fleeing persecution, Eijk has said that economic migrants often are obliged to build up their native countries; and they have obligations to the country into which they immigrate. He has also spoken with clarity about fundamental differences between Islam and Christianity. Eijk values reverence in the liturgy but has so far kept himself out of the contentious issue of restricting the Traditional Latin Mass. During the Covid pandemic, the cardinal was an ardent supporter of vaccination against the virus, drawing on his medical knowledge. Despite concerns over the vaccines’ safety and efficacy, and other moral concerns about them, he saw their use as a “moral obligation” to protect oneself and others from the virus. Over the years, Eijk has become used to sometimes vehement criticism for his unabashed adherence to the Catholic Faith in all its facets, but he nevertheless provides an example for pastors who desire to “feed the flock” given them by Christ, no matter what wolves may be prowling around. As well as his native Dutch, Cardinal Eijk is fluent in Italian and English and proficient in several other languages.","• Theology/Ideology: Eijk is solidly orthodox, advocating for pro-life positions and the traditional understanding of marriage, while supporting the Second Vatican Council as a work of the Holy Spirit.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his clear and uncompromising stance on Church teachings, Eijk balances this with tact and diplomacy, particularly in contentious discussions.  
• Power Base: He has maintained a stable number of vocations in Utrecht amid secularization and has garnered influence through his leadership roles in the Episcopal Conference and the Pontifical Academy for Life.  
• Core Motivation: Eijk is driven by a profound commitment to reviving faith in Christ and the Church, focusing on personal evangelization, Eucharistic devotion, and addressing contemporary moral issues through his medical and theological expertise.","Cardinal Willem Jacobus Eijk exemplifies a steadfast commitment to orthodox theology, advocating for pro-life positions and the traditional understanding of marriage while upholding the principles of the Second Vatican Council as a manifestation of the Holy Spirit.

74,Péter Erdő,"The eldest of six children, Cardinal Péter Erdő was raised by devout Catholic parents in a family in which the Faith was “woven into the fabric of our life.1 He grew up under communism, and when he was four, his family was forced to flee with just the clothes on their backs after invading troops burned down their family home in 1956. He then experienced various degrees of discrimination on account of his Faith. He was educated at a Piarist boys’ school in Budapest. The “reality of God” began to attract the young Péter Erdő as an altar boy, giving meaning and direction to his life. He entered the seminary after much prayer, believing that helping people toward salvation was so important that it required dedicating one’s whole life to it.2 After his ordination to the priesthood in 1975 — which he calls one of the three happiest moments in his life — he spent two years in parish service before being sent to Rome, where he earned degrees in theology and canon law at the Pontifical Lateran University (1980). In the following years, he taught on various faculties of canon law and theology in Hungary and abroad, including Buenos Aires, while serving as an ecclesiastical clerk and judge. During this time, he published manuals and articles on canon law. He was a research fellow at the University of California, Berkeley in 1995 to 1996. For some time, he was rector of the Hungarian College in Rome, while teaching at the Gregorian and Lateran Universities. John Paul II consecrated Erdő bishop in 2000 and made him primate of all Hungary as ordinary of the Esztergom-Budapest Archdiocese in 2003. Erdő was elevated to the cardinalate the same year. Speaking German, Italian, French, Spanish, English, and his native Hungarian, Erdő was elected president of the Hungarian Catholic Episcopal Conference in 2005 and, in the same year, president of the Council of European Episcopal Conferences (CCEE). The esteem he holds among his episcopal colleagues was shown in his reelection to the CCEE in 2011 as well as his appointment to help oversee the Secretariat of State’s “Second Section,” which is responsible for diplomatic relations. Since 2003 he has participated in all the assemblies of the Synod of Bishops, with the special honor given by Pope Francis to serve as relator for the synods of 2014 and 2015. He is the author of more than 250 articles and 25 books. Formed amid the hardships of atheistic communism, Cardinal Péter Erdő is widely regarded as a great intellect and a man of culture. A prolific and supremely well-read author, Erdő is also a proficient teacher and highly accomplished canonist and Scripture scholar for which he has received a number of awards including honorary doctorates from several institutions including the Institut Catholique de Paris (1996) and most recently the Vox Canonica Award in 2023, a prize for distinguished canonists. He has a love for the post–Vatican II liturgy, especially its emphasis on Old Testament readings. Although he prefers the Ordinary Form of the Mass, he is willing to permit the Extraordinary Form and will support it if called to do so but he made no public comment on Traditionis Custodes and its restrictions on the traditional Latin Mass. He sees the Eucharist and the priesthood as closely related and is opposed to optional celibacy for priests. A defender of the hierarchical structure of the Church, he is a priest with a pastoral heart for whom the importance of salvation was the driving force for being ordained. He has placed great emphasis on the New Evangelization and ministering to youth. Missionary work is central to his pastoral approach, and he has shown great concern for the Church’s vocation crisis. Vocations in his own diocese have mostly fluctuated in number during his tenure: in 2002, the total number of priests was 358, and rose to as high as 443 in 2013 before declining to 365 in 2021. Male religious increased slightly, from 173 in 2002 to 199 in 2021, but female religious over halved, from 699 in 2022 to 303 in 2021. Cautious, risk-averse, even timid, Erdő was, at 51, one of the Church’s youngest cardinals when John Paul II elevated him to the College of Cardinals in 2003. On political issues such as immigration, an issue that Hungary has been grappling with for some years, the cardinal has conveyed a balanced approach, recognizing the right to migrate but also aware of dangers of integrating refugees without endangering political stability. A true balance between solidarity and mercy must be struck, he believes. The cardinal is concerned about persecuted Christians (“We see Christ’s disciples in them”) and yet has a largely benign view of Islam. Erdő takes a very positive attitude toward the Orthodox church and keenly supports dialogue with non-Christian religions, emphasizing the value of Dignitatis Humanae. His emphasis on unity and his role as a bridge between East and West have solidified his standing as a significant Church leader. Cardinal Erdő has spent many years of his priesthood as a teacher — a profession for which he has a great fondness. He frequently underlines the importance of having a personal relationship with Christ, something he sees as important for the Church as it faces a grave crisis because of secularism and relativism. He firmly upholds the existence of natural law and his experience of communism has taught him the importance religion can play in filling the void left by the collapse of a political ideology, and that only a personal relationship with Christ brings true freedom and happiness. “If faith is the most important thing in life, then serving the faith of others, passing on the faith, teaching the faith, and especially ministering at the liturgy are the greatest things in life,” he said in August 2024. Helping in “the salvation of others,” he added, is the important and useful task. “This is the main motivation that I felt even as a boy,” he said. “And so, I gradually came to the decision to enter the seminary.” Erdő denies universalism, the idea that all are saved, but nevertheless believes that all can be saved. Ultimately, he believes, only through Jesus Christ can mankind find its way to God. He is in favor of pastoral accompaniment for “remarried” divorcees but only if there is “no doubt” about the Church’s teaching on the indissolubility of marriage. He is firmly against the acceptance of homosexual unions but favors pastoral support for those suffering same-sex attraction. He upholds Humanae Vitae, is strongly pro-life, and has a fervent Marian devotion. An admirer of Pope Paul VI, the cardinal was a favorite of the late Cardinal George Pell who saw the Hungarian cardinal as a highly suitable Successor of Peter, someone who could above all restore the rule of law in the Vatican after the Francis pontificate.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Péter Erdő emphasizes the importance of personal relationships with Christ and holds a strong commitment to traditional Catholic teachings, including opposition to universalism and homosexual unions.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his cautious and risk-averse demeanor, Erdő is regarded as a thoughtful mediator who seeks a balanced approach to complex issues like immigration and interfaith dialogue.  
• Power Base: As a prominent leader in the Hungarian Catholic Church and former president of the Council of European Episcopal Conferences, Erdő commands significant respect among his episcopal colleagues and has extensive international connections.

In 1971, he was called to Germany as a member of his community’s General Council, and in 1974, he was elected Superior General. On December 22, 1990, Errázuriz Ossa was appointed titular Archbishop of Hólar and Secretary of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, receiving episcopal ordination on January 6, 1991. He was named Archbishop-Bishop of Valparaíso on September 24, 1996, and later transferred to the Archdiocese of Santiago on April 24, 1998.

Errázuriz Ossa became Archbishop Emeritus of Santiago, Chile, on December 15, 2010. On February 21, 2001, St. John Paul II created and proclaimed Errázuriz Ossa a Cardinal, assigning him the Title of S. Maria della Pace (Our Lady of Peace). He participated in the conclaves of April 2005 and March 2013. On April 13, 2013, Cardinal Errázuriz Ossa was appointed as a member of the Council of Cardinals established to advise Pope Francis in the government of the universal Church and to study a plan for reforming the Roman Curia. Cardinal Francisco Javier Errázuriz Ossa played a significant role in the 2018 sexual abuse crisis in Chile, primarily related to his handling of allegations against Father Fernando Karadima and subsequent cover-up attempts. In 2018, it emerged that Errázuriz had privately admitted to closing an investigation into Karadima’s alleged abuses, stating that he did so to “protect them,” aware that his actions could be criticized if the accusations became public. As the crisis unfolded, Errázuriz’s actions came under further intense scrutiny. Errázuriz’s involvement in the crisis led to his departure from Pope Francis’ Council of Cardinal Advisers in 2018. His actions significantly contributed to the broader scandal that rocked the Church in Chile and led to widespread calls for reform and accountability within the Church hierarchy.","• Theology/Ideology: Errázuriz Ossa emphasizes the importance of pastoral care and community engagement, rooted in his Schönstatt background and extensive theological education.

76,Ricardo Ezzati Andrello,"Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati Andrello is an Archbishop Emeritus of Santiago, Chile, known for his social concerns and commitment to education and evangelization but like many other Chilean bishops, he became embroiled in allegations of covering up sexual abuse cases in 2018. Born in Campiglia dei Berici, Vicenza (Italy), on 7 January 1942, at the age of seventeen, Ezzati chose to enter the seminary for the Salesians of Saint John Bosco, opting for a novitiate outside of Italy. In 1959, he transferred to Chile to carry out his novitiate with the Salesians of Quilpué, Valparaíso, marking the beginning of his lifelong connection to the country. Ezzati Andrello completed his studies in philosophy at the Catholic University of Valparaíso and theology at the Salesian Pontifical University in Rome. He made his first profession as a Salesian in 1961 and his perpetual vows in 1966. On March 18, 1970, he was ordained a priest for the Salesians. Following his ordination, Ezzati Andrello pursued further education, obtaining a licentiate in religious studies at the Institut de Pastoral catéchétique of Strasbourg and a title of teacher of religion and philosophy from the Catholic University of Valparaíso. He served in various roles within the Salesian community, including head of youth ministry, director of community and Salesian work, and provincial inspector of the Salesians in Chile. His career in the Church hierarchy began on June 28, 1996, when he was appointed Bishop of Valdivia, receiving episcopal ordination on September 8 of the same year. He later served as an auxiliary bishop of Santiago de Chile from 2001 to 2006. On December 27, 2006, he was appointed Metropolitan Archbishop of Concepción. In 2010, Ezzati Andrello became the Archbishop of Santiago, where he worked with youth and prisoners. He played a significant role in addressing issues within the Church, including disbanding a priestly association whose founder was found guilty of sexual abuse. Pope Francis elevated Ricardo Ezzati Andrello to the college of cardinals in a consistory on February 22, 2014, at the age of 72. He was assigned the title of Santissimo Redentore a Valmelaina. As a cardinal, he took part in the Synod on the Family in 2014 and 2015. Throughout his career, Cardinal Ezzati Andrello has been known for his social concerns, acting as a mediator between laborers and employers, and for his commitment to education and evangelization. His life and work embody his own words: “I am of Italian origins and of Chilean vocation,” reflecting his deep connection to both his native Italy and his adopted home of Chile. In 2018, like many other Chilean bishop, Ezzati became a focal point of criticism from abuse survivors for his alleged mishandling of several abuse cases. Cardinal Ezzati consistently denied any participation in covering up abuse.

78,Kevin Joseph Farrell,"Cardinal Kevin Joseph Farrell is a progressive Irish American prelate and former Legionary of Christ who is currently Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church, responsible for the running of Vatican City during the interregnum period between two popes. He is a much-trusted papal administrator who has been appointed to a number of significant positions as well as serving as prefect for the Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life. Born on September 2, 1947, in Dublin, Ireland, after completing primary and secondary school, he attended the University of Salamanca in Spain and the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. Farrell holds a licentiate in philosophy and theology from the University of St. Thomas in Rome and, unusually for a cleric, has a Master of Business Administration which he obtained from the University of Notre Dame. In 1966, Farrell entered the Congregation of the Legionaries of Christ and was ordained a priest on December 24, 1978. He has since held numerous significant positions within the Church hierarchy. After his ordination, Farrell began his service as a chaplain at the University of Monterrey in Mexico, where he conducted seminars in bioethics and social ethics. In the early 1980s, he left the Legionaries of Christ for reasons which he later stated were due to “intellectual differences” he had with them. His departure from the Legion occurred long before the scandals surrounding the order’s founder, Marcial Maciel, came to light. Farrell has always maintained that he never knew anything about Maciel’s misconduct during his time with the order. After leaving the Legion, he transitioned to the Archdiocese of Washington, where he served in various parishes and held significant administrative roles. His responsibilities included director of the Spanish Catholic Center, acting director of Catholic Charities, and secretary of finance. In 2001, Farrell was appointed vicar general and an auxiliary bishop of Washington. During that time, from 2002 to 2006, Farrell shared a residence with then-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick and worked with him as his vicar general. Despite his length of time in close proximity to McCarrick, Cardinal Farrell has consistently maintained he had no knowledge of disgraced former cardinal’s past sexual abuse, saying he was “shocked” when he heard the allegations, and had “never heard any rumors” about the abuse. In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as the bishop of the Diocese of Dallas, where he served for a decade. During that time he made a significant positive impact on the diocese: He was credited with helping move the diocese past previous scandals and to “a better place” according to local Catholics, and was seen as a skilled administrator and “fixer” who helped clean up and stabilize the diocese. In 2016, Pope Francis appointed Farrell as the prefect of the newly established Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life, marking his transition to a high-ranking Vatican position. Francis elevated Farrell to the rank of cardinal later that year. In a show of further trust in the cardinal, Pope Francis has appointed Farrell to other numerous positions of responsibility, first as Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church on February 14, 2019, and the following year, President of the Commission for Confidential Matters. In 2022, Francis appointed him President of the Committee for Investments in June 2022. On January 1, 2024, Farrell was appointed as President of the Court of Cassation of the Vatican City State. However, he has not always acted with the propriety some might expect. In 2019, it was revealed that Farrell had received $29,000 from Bishop Michael J. Bransfield for apartment renovations in Rome. While Farrell reportedly returned the money when improprieties came to light, the incident raised eyebrows about financial practices among high-ranking clergy. In 2018, Farrell stirred controversy by stating that priests have “no credibility” when it comes to marriage preparation. He argued that priests “have never lived the experience” and therefore may not be the best people to train others for marriage. He made similar comments a year earlier when he said priests have “no credibility when it comes to living the reality of marriage.” Despite these controversies, Farrell appears to have won even more trust from Pope Francis who continues to award him with significant responsibilities in the Vatican. He was given another significant responsibility in November 2024 when Pope Francis appointed him the “sole administrator” to oversee vital reform of the Vatican’s pension system. Cardinal George Pell, the former prefect of the Secretariat for the Economy, frequently warned that the Vatican’s pension system was unsustainable. Among the curia’s senior officials, Farrell is reputed by some in the Vatican as being the most competent in administrative and financial matters. Farrell is very much of the same mind as Francis when it comes to the Church’s pastoral teaching and they have a shared vision for the Church. In particular, he expressed support for Pope Francis’ approach to Holy Communion for the divorced and remarried. Farrell stated that Amoris Laetitia — Pope Francis’ controversial apostolic exhortation on family issues — is “the Holy Spirit speaking” and that it is faithful to Church doctrine while carrying forward the teachings of previous popes. He is a keen promoter of synodality, viewing it as a crucial process for improving dialogue, listening, community discernment, and shared apostolate. Farrell also emphasizes the importance of lay involvement and the need for the Church to acknowledge past mistakes as it moves forward in this synodal path. Farrell believes that women “need to have a voice and a say” in the Church and during a penitential service before the 2023 Synod on Synodality, he asked for forgiveness for sins against women, expressing shame for times when the Church “has not recognized and defended the dignity of women.” The Irish-American cardinal has a markedly open and normalizing approach to homosexually active people, stressing in 2021 that they “must never be excluded from the pastoral care and love and concern of the Church.” He is also not opposed to the involvement of LGBT advocates at Church events, as occurred in 2018 when such an advocate accompanied Farrell at the closing Mass of the pastoral congress of the World Meeting of Families in Dublin. Farrell also joined fellow Cardinals Joseph Tobin and Robert McElroy in publicly praising Fr. James Martin’s 2017 book on building bridges with the LGBT community, calling it a “much-needed book.”1 Critics said the book failed to clearly explain or defend the Church’s teaching on homosexuality and sexual ethics, and that Martin endorsed organizations previously censured by Church authorities.","• Theology/Ideology: Farrell is a progressive theologian aligned with Pope Francis, advocating for synodality and inclusivity, particularly regarding the roles of women and the LGBTQ+ community within the Church.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is recognized as a skilled administrator and ""fixer,"" known for his ability to stabilize institutions and navigate complex situations while maintaining a collaborative approach.  
• Power Base: Farrell's power stems from his extensive administrative experience in the Vatican and his close relationship with Pope Francis, who trusts him with significant responsibilities across various committees.

79,Víctor Manuel Fernández,"Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández is a controversial and progressive Argentinian theologian who has ghostwritten several of Pope Francis’ key documents and currently holds the prestigious and influential Vatican position of prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith. Born on July 18, 1962, in Alcira Gigena, a small town in the rural area of Córdoba, Argentina, his father Emilio was a storekeeper who died in 1978, the same year Fernández entered the Major Seminary of Cordoba. His widowed mother, whom Fernández regularly visited before taking up his Vatican position in 2023, is in her late 80s. After completing his secondary education in his hometown, Fernández, who goes by the nickname “Tucho,”1 was sent to seminary on the advice of Father Ramón Artemio Staffolani, an Argentine priest who was an important mentor and friend. Father Staffolani was consecrated Bishop of Rio Cuarto in 1990. He was always present in Fernández’s life: he was the local priest throughout Fernandez’s childhood, not only as parish priest but also as the chaplain at the school Fernández attended, and that Staffolani had founded. As Fernández’s spiritual guide, Staffolani helped the young priest climb the ecclesiastical ladder. As bishop, Argentine sources also say that Staffolani, who died in 2006, was known for possessing a lax style of governing in his diocese, allowing priests to live irregular lives from a moral standpoint. The sources also say Staffolani was the first to introduce Fernández to the “Theology of the People,” a type of liberation theology that emphasizes respect for the culture and popular religious expressions of the poor. Fernández was ordained a priest on August 5, 1986, and incardinated in Rio Cuarto, an agriculturally rich area of Argentina. After his ordination, he was sent to Rome where, in 1988, he obtained a licentiate in Biblical Theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University and in 1990 he obtained a doctorate in Theology at the Faculty of Theology of the Catholic University of Argentina (UCA), with a thesis on the relationship between knowledge and life in St. Bonaventure. Back in his diocese, he carried out various tasks related to formation in the diocesan seminary and was the founder and director of two small centers of lay formation: the Jesus Buen Pastor College of Science and Sacred Philosophy Teachers in Rio Cuarto and a Diocesan Institute for Lay Formation. From 1993 to 2000, he was parish priest of Santa Teresita, a position in which he paid special pastoral attention to children and young people, distinguishing himself by celebrating liturgies he regarded as adapted to these groups, for example, “clown Masses” for children.2 He was known to be deeply involved in the Pentecostal-style charismatic movement and, sources say, used to celebrate Mass outside because there were too many people for the church’s capacity. He subsequently left that diocese and moved to Buenos Aires where he joined the Faculty of Theology at the Catholic University of Argentina. In 2007, the bishops of Latin America met in the shrine of Aparecida, Brazil, where Father Víctor Fernández played a key role as theological advisor to then-Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio and participated actively in the drafting of the final document. Fernández’s thinking was influential, most notably his belief that the contemplative and apostolic are one and should not be divided.3 In this way, Fernández appeared to indicate that he did not particularly value the contemplative life but, in his opinion, believes it should be merely a complement to the active life, or to a certain type of apostolic life, consisting of practical love for one’s neighbor. In 2008, he was appointed dean of the theology faculty of the Catholic University of Argentina. The following year the then-Chancellor of the University, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio, appointed him rector. The appointment, however, did not obtain Vatican approval due to public statements Fernández had made in a local newspaper and other complaints about published material he had written. In July 2023, Cardinal Gerhard Müller confirmed that the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith had a file containing these theological concerns about Fernández at that time. These complaints and concerns delayed his appointment, and it was not until May 20, 2011, nearly two years later, that he finally received a nihil obstat from the Vatican and was sworn in.4 On May 13, 2013, barely two months after his election to the Roman pontificate, Pope Francis appointed Fernández as archbishop in partibus, granting him the titular see in Tiburnia and maintaining his position as rector of the Catholic University of Argentina. In June 2018, Pope Francis appointed Fernández to succeed Bishop Héctor Aguer as Archbishop of La Plata, an important see in Argentina. Bishop Aguer, who had relatively orthodox views, had differences with Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio and later, after Bergoglio was elected Pope.5 Pope Francis named Archbishop Fernández prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith on July 1, 2023, and personally issued a letter redefining the mission of the Vatican’s doctrinal office. His appointment was celebrated by those who saw it as furthering Francis’ vision for the Church, but it aroused concern from orthodox faithful both inside and outside the Vatican due to Archbishop Fernández’ theology, previous writings and comments.6 Pope Francis created Archbishop Victor Manuel Fernández a cardinal in the consistory of September 30, 2023. Fernández’s leadership has appeared to be characterized by a concern for social justice, the defense of human rights, concern for the most disadvantaged, and pastoral revitalization. He has expressed firm opposition to the legalization of abortion, defending the rights of the unborn child; however, his advocacy for education and culture is disputed. As bishop, he admitted he had “made mistakes” in handling an abuse case. An abuse tracking organization called his record on abuse “troubling.” When appointed DDF prefect, Francis took that dicastery’s responsibility for handling abuse cases away from his purview. Cardinal Fernández’s Approach Cardinal Víctor Manuel Fernández is a prelate fully convinced of his own opinions and his unorthodox vision for the Church. This makes him a controversial and polarizing figure whose relatively rapid rise to one of the most influential positions in the Vatican has generated both praise and intense criticism. Fernández has been a constant source of conflict and controversy throughout his ecclesiastical career. His writings, especially past books such as Heal Me with Your Mouth: The Art of Kissing and The Mystical Passion: Spirituality and Sensuality, have been the subject of intense scrutiny, and drawn criticism from many sectors of the Church. Despite these conflicts and controversies and notably after the death of Benedict XVI, Fernández was elevated to one of the most important positions within the Catholic hierarchy that Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger had famously held for 24 years. The appointment not only marked a turning point in his career but set the Church under the current pontificate in a distinctly more radical direction. Observers have also said that his elevation says more about Pope Francis’ unwavering confidence in him rather than any particular recognition of his prowess in theology, which orthodox theologians such as his predecessor Cardinal Gerhard Müller insist he does not possess. Fernández has theological training but others say his academic output fails to measure up to the lofty position he now holds. His focus on pastoral theology and his accessible and popular writing style have been seen by many as lacking the theological depth and precision necessary to lead the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, traditionally headed by internationally renowned theologians. He dissents from the orthodox reading of Humanae Vitae, has spearheaded non-liturgical blessings of same sex couples by priests, and restricted traditional Latin Masses three years before Pope Francis made the suppression universal. The polarization Fernández generates within the Church has exacerbated existing divisions between progressive and conservative factions. His critics say that his history of controversy, of dogmatically adhering to what he sees as the justness of his own convictions, and his reputation for lacking theological depth and expertise, could undermine the authority of the dicastery and, by extension, that of the Pope himself. His supporters, meanwhile, argue he is helping Francis to chart a new and important path for the Church, one that underscores a pastoral approach focused on “the joy of the gospel” rather than rigid rules, and therefore seeming to bring the Church closer to people. It is hard to deny, however, that Cardinal Fernández’s meteoric rise owes itself not so much to his conventional theological credentials but to his alignment with Pope Francis’s reformist vision and his willingness to challenge the status quo. A Fernández papacy would therefore undoubtedly ensure that Francis’ reforms continue and probably with even greater fervor while leaving deeper divisions, disharmony, and dissent in their wake.","• Theology/Ideology: Fernández is a progressive theologian who champions a pastoral approach to Church doctrine, emphasizing social justice and the integration of popular religious expressions.

80,Ángel Fernández Artime,"Cardinal Ángel Fernández Artime is a Spanish prelate, the tenth head of the Salesian Order, and a longtime acquaintance of Pope Francis. Born into a fishing family on August 21, 1960, in Gozón-Luanco, Asturias, Spain, he joined the Salesians of Don Bosco, taking his first vows on September 3, 1978, and his perpetual vows on June 17, 1984. Fernández Artime was ordained a priest on July 4, 1987, in León, Spain. He holds a licentiate in pastoral theology, and in philosophy and pedagogy. He has served in various roles within the Salesian order, including as provincial delegate for youth ministry, director of a school in Ourense, and provincial counsellor and vicar. From 2000 to 2006, Fernández Artime was the Provincial of the Salesian Province of Leon. In 2009, he was appointed Superior of the Province of South Argentina, based in Buenos Aires. His leadership skills were further recognized when he was elected Rector Major of the Salesian Congregation on March 25, 2014, becoming the tenth Successor of Don Bosco. This appointment made him the first Spaniard to hold this office. In September 2023, Pope Francis elevated Fernández Artime to the rank of cardinal, making him the first cleric to be made a cardinal while heading a religious order. He was appointed to the titular see of Ursona with the dignity of archbishop and consecrated on April 20, 2024, at the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. As Rector Major, Fernández Artime led the Salesian Congregation, one of the largest religious orders, for a decade from 2014 to 2024. He was confirmed for a second six-year term as Rector Major in 2020, demonstrating the confidence placed in his leadership. He was scheduled to end his mandate as Rector Major on August 16, 2024. On January 6, 2025, Pope Francis appointed the cardinal pro-prefect of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life. Cardinal Fernández Artime is reported to be close to Pope Francis on pastoral matters. He is passionate about education and is especially concerned about young prisoners. Accompanying young people through life “is in my DNA, and wherever I go and whatever I’m asked to do, the emphasis will always be on young people, education, the most vulnerable,” he has said. In an interview in 2018, he called anti-migration policies “inhumane” and expressed his opposition to seeing immigration as a security threat, arguing that “another person is not a danger.” He has also supported Francis’ line on the war in Ukraine. Cardinal Fernández Artime supports a synodal approach in the Church, in line with the call of Pope Francis. As Rector Major of the Salesians, he emphasized the importance of “walking together” and seeking new paths for evangelization, especially among young people. He took part in the Synod on Synodality. He has expressed firm loyalty to the Pope. In his homily on becoming a cardinal, Fernandez Artime said: “Our service as pastors of the Church and also as cardinals is not an honor. It is first and foremost a service of communion with the Pope. Don Bosco taught us to always say ‘Long live the Pope’. We, the Salesian Family and Salesians in the world are and will always be with the Pope. (…) And I believe that it is a great second contribution that we must give to the Church. (…) Service to the Pope, to the Church, and to the people.” He also recalled the following words of Don Bosco, the importance of Mary’s presence, and that “in its time you will understand everything.” Quoting the Salesian founder’s words uttered shortly before his death, he said: “I live a reality that I don’t understand, but I entrust myself to the Lord and to Our Lady. It is certain that they will help us understand what we are experiencing. I invite everyone to put ourselves in the hands of the Lord and of His Mother.” Under Fernández Artime’s leadership, the Salesians have grown closer to the Vatican, notably by signing a partnership with the Dicastery for Communication in 2017. In his role as cardinal, Fernández Artime served as a member of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life before being appointed its pro-prefect in January 2025.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Fernández Artime emphasizes a synodal approach in the Church, advocating for collaboration and engagement with youth and marginalized communities.

82,Filipe Neri Ferrão,"Il Cardinale Filipe Neri António Sebastião do Rosário Ferrão è l’Arcivescovo di Goa e Daman e settimo Patriarca delle Indie Orientali, che si è concentrato sulla pastorale familiare, sul dialogo interreligioso e sulla giustizia sociale, in particolare sui migranti e sul cambiamento climatico. Nato il 20 gennaio 1953 a Mapusa, Goa, India, è il più giovane di tre figli e ha completato i suoi studi filosofici e teologici presso il Seminario Pontificio di Pune. Ha proseguito la sua formazione a Roma, ottenendo la licenza in teologia con specializzazione in Teologia Biblica presso la Pontificia Università Urbaniana. Inoltre, ha conseguito una licenza in Catechetica e Teologia Pastorale presso l’Istituto Internazionale Lumen Vitae di Bruxelles, in Belgio. Ferrão è stato ordinato sacerdote il 28 ottobre 1979 per l’Arcidiocesi di Goa e Daman. Nel corso del suo ministero sacerdotale, ha ricoperto diversi incarichi, tra cui quello di vicario parrocchiale; prefetto di seminario e docente presso il Seminario Minore di Nostra Signora a Saligao-Pilerne; direttore diocesano di un centro per laici; consulente ecclesiastico; e vicario episcopale. Il 10 aprile 1994, Ferrão è stato ordinato vescovo ausiliare di Goa e Daman, prima di essere insediato come 34° Arcivescovo di Goa e Daman e settimo Patriarca delle Indie Orientali nel marzo 2004. Il Cardinale Ferrão ha ricoperto diverse posizioni significative all’interno della Chiesa cattolica in India. È stato membro della Conferenza Episcopale Cattolica dell’India (CBCI)1, e la Conferenza dei Vescovi Cattolici dell’India (CCBI)2. In entrambe le organizzazioni, ha presieduto la Commissione Laici. È stato anche ex presidente della Commissione Giustizia, Sviluppo e Pace del Consiglio Episcopale della Regione Occidentale e vicepresidente del Forum del Servizio Sociale della Regione Occidentale. Papa Francesco ha elevato Ferrão a cardinale il 27 agosto 2022, diventando così il primo Arcivescovo di Goa e Daman ad essere nominato cardinale dall’istituzione della sede episcopale nel 1557. Nel 2023, il Cardinale Ferrão è stato eletto nuovo Presidente della Federazione delle Conferenze Episcopali dell’Asia (FABC), e assumerà l’incarico nel gennaio 2025. Questa posizione lo pone in un ruolo cruciale per guidare gli sforzi della Chiesa cattolica in Asia, in particolare in relazione al processo sinodale in corso avviato da Papa Francesco. Il cardinale indiano ha partecipato al Sinodo sulla sinodalità del 2024 ed è stato scelto personalmente da Papa Francesco come membro della commissione che ha redatto la relazione finale del Sinodo. Prelato simpatico e cordiale, il Cardinale Ferrão è noto per il suo approccio pastorale, in particolare per la sua attenzione alla pastorale familiare. Visita regolarmente le parrocchie della sua arcidiocesi, rivolgendosi alle famiglie e offrendo loro sostegno spirituale. Ha un interesse particolare per i giovani e i bambini, incoraggiandoli a diventare buoni cittadini e membri della Chiesa. Il cardinale ha espresso forti opinioni sulle questioni ambientali e sul cambiamento climatico, in linea con la posizione sottolineata da Papa Francesco nella sua enciclica Laudato Si’. Come molti vescovi indiani, ha anche dimostrato un forte impegno nel promuovere il dialogo interreligioso, che considera nella sua nazione a maggioranza indù come essenziale per promuovere la comprensione e il rispetto tra le diverse comunità religiose. Tuttavia, le posizioni interreligiose liberali del Cardinale hanno suscitato polemiche nel 2021, quando ha incoraggiato il suo clero a visitare gli idoli di Ganesha, una divinità con la testa di elefante molto importante nell’Induismo, durante il Ganesh Chaturthi, una festa che celebra la nascita della divinità. Fu redatta una petizione che criticava il cardinale per “essere testimone di un relativismo religioso radicale che mette il Gesù vivente sullo stesso piano di un Ganesh d’argilla”. Il cardinale ha risposto dicendo che la critica andava contro lo “spirito autentico” del dialogo interreligioso e del rispetto reciproco. “È penoso notare che alcune espressioni usate recentemente in pubblico da alcuni membri della Chiesa cattolica possono aver ferito i sentimenti religiosi di altre tradizioni religiose”, ha detto. Il Cardinale Ferrão ha sostenuto fermamente l’attenzione di Papa Francesco per i migranti, sottolineando che “non ci può essere un domani senza migranti e rifugiati”. Crede che i migranti giochino un ruolo cruciale nel plasmare il futuro della società e che debbano essere valorizzati per il loro contributo. Le sue opinioni vanno oltre la semplice tolleranza, fino al sostegno attivo dei migranti. Ha partecipato al lancio di iniziative per assistere i migranti, come ad esempio un nuovo portale digitale che mira a sostenere i migranti. Nel 2018, il cardinale si è scontrato con i sostenitori del partito al potere BJP quando ha pubblicato una lettera pastorale in cui chiedeva una maggiore responsabilità sociale nei confronti dei poveri, delle loro famiglie, della comunità e della società. Ha criticato in particolare l’estrema povertà, il calpestamento dei diritti umani e un pericolo per la Costituzione. Nel 2016, il cardinale è finito sotto tiro per il suo coinvolgimento nella vendita di un terreno della Chiesa a basso prezzo a degli sviluppatori nel 2006, che ha provocato accuse contro di lui di violazione della legge canonica e civile. L’arcidiocesi ha respinto le accuse, definendole “maliziose e maligne” e insistendo sul fatto che il prezzo era più alto di altri che aveva ricevuto e corrispondeva alle valutazioni. Il Cardinale Ferrão parla il Konkani, la lingua di oltre 2 milioni di persone sulla costa occidentale della penisola indiana, oltre all’inglese, al portoghese e forse ad altre lingue.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Ferrão emphasizes family pastoral care, interreligious dialogue, and social justice, particularly focusing on migrants and climate change.

83,Fernando Filoni,"Cardinal Fernando Filoni is a distinguished Holy See diplomat and current grand master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem who served as prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, deputy Vatican secretary of state, and apostolic nuncio in Iraq during the 2003 Iraq War. Born on April 15, 1946, in Manduria (Taranto), Italy, Filoni was ordained  priest on July 3, 1970, after completing his studies in philosophy and canon law and obtaining a doctorate in each. He also obtained a diploma in public opinion sciences and techniques, specializing in journalism. During his early years in Rome, he served as an assistant pastor and taught in local high schools. In 1981, Filoni entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See, serving in various countries including Sri Lanka, Iran, Brazil, and the Philippines. He was stationed in Tehran during the bloodiest period of the Iran-Iraq war. His time in Hong Kong from 1992 to 2001 was particularly notable, as he was tasked with following the situation of the Church in China during a period of social and religious changes. He was known as Pope John Paul II’s bridge to China’s bishops, both in the official and unofficial churches, in the hope of reconciling them to the Holy See. While there, he opened a “study mission” on mainland China. In 2001, Filoni was appointed apostolic nuncio to Iraq and Jordan, and elevated to archbishop. He remained in Iraq during the 2003 war, demonstrating the Church’s closeness to the people as Baghdad was bombarded. Three years later he came close to being killed in Baghdad when a car bomb exploded next to the nunciature. In 2006, he was transferred to the Philippines as apostolic nuncio. Filoni’s career in the Vatican advanced rapidly. In 2007, he was appointed substitute of the Secretariat of State, an influential position and effectively the Pope’s chief of staff responsible for the day-to-day running of the Holy See. In 2011, Pope Benedict XVI named him prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (Propaganda Fide), a highly prestigious and responsible position that used to carry the title “The Red Pope.” In February 2012, Benedict XVI elevated him to the cardinalate, and in 2018 Pope Francis raised him to the rank of cardinal-bishop. He has served as the grand master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem since December 8, 2019. Cardinal Filoni has gained a reputation as an expert on Chinese affairs and the Middle East. On China, he described the 2018 secret provisional agreement between the Vatican and Beijing as having “historical significance” but in a long 2019 interview with L’Osservatore Romano he expressed some apprehension, saying he understood “the perplexities, sometimes I share them.” A few months after the article appeared, and two years before the normal retiring age of cardinals, Filoni, 73, was transferred from serving as prefect of Propaganda Fide to being appointed grand master of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulcher of Jerusalem. On the Israel-Hamas war that broke out on October 7, 2023, Filoni proposed a balanced solution that recognizes the rights of both parties and calls for concrete actions to end the conflict, underlining the need to move away from the vindictive logic and pursue a lasting peace based on mutual respect and recognition of the rights of both peoples. He strongly supports a two-state solution and believes no other alternative exists. On other matters, Filoni is known to be a sponsor of the Neocatechumenal movement, a controversial group that has sparked debate for some of its unorthodox liturgical practices and interpretations. Filoni is a fervent believer in the Second Vatican Council. He is also a strong advocate of the Synod of Bishops and, contentiously, episcopal conferences about which he has just written a book. A reserved and discreet figure, a man of pastoral sensitivity with a wealth of curial and diplomatic experience, Cardinal Filoni has been increasingly considered papabile. As the Vaticanist John Allen pointed out in 2013, Filoni has a global vision and international experience, possesses important diplomatic and governing skills, has shown pastoral sensitivity, and is uncompromising on Church teaching. Should cardinal electors want to return the papacy to tried and tested safe hands of the Italians, he may well fit the bill. On the negative side, Cardinal Filoni has no experience in leading a diocese, is identified with Italian old guard bureaucracy, and despite many attributes working in his favor, he was not often mentioned as papabile at the last conclave. That may change, however, at the next one.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Filoni is a fervent believer in the Second Vatican Council and strongly supports a two-state solution for Israel and Palestine, emphasizing mutual respect.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his reserved and discreet demeanor, he possesses significant diplomatic skills and pastoral sensitivity that enable him to navigate complex international issues.

84,Michael Louis Fitzgerald,"Il Cardinale Michael Louis Fitzgerald, presidente emerito del Pontificio Consiglio per il Dialogo Interreligioso, è un Missionario d’Africa la cui lunga e distinta carriera nella promozione del dialogo tra le fedi è culminata con la nomina a nunzio apostolico in Egitto e delegato presso la Lega degli Stati Arabi. Nato il 17 agosto 1937 a Walsall, in Inghilterra, di origine irlandese, Fitzgerald è stato ordinato sacerdote dei Missionari d’Africa (Padri Bianchi) il 3 febbraio 1961 dal Cardinale William Godfrey. I risultati accademici di Fitzgerald includono un dottorato in teologia presso la Pontificia Università Gregoriana e una laurea con lode in arabo presso la Scuola di Studi Orientali e Africani dell’Università di Londra. La carriera di Fitzgerald comprende l’insegnamento, il lavoro pastorale e ruoli significativi all’interno della Chiesa cattolica. Ha insegnato al Pontificio Istituto di Studi Arabi e Islamici di Roma e all’Università di Makerere in Uganda, prima di dedicarsi al lavoro pastorale in Sudan. Nel 1987, è stato nominato Segretario del Segretariato per i non cristiani, diventando poi Presidente del Pontificio Consiglio per il Dialogo Interreligioso nel 2002. Giovanni Paolo II ha nominato Fitzgerald alla sede titolare di Nepte il 6 dicembre 1991 e lo ha consacrato vescovo il 6 gennaio 1992. Nel 2006, Benedetto XVI ha nominato Fitzgerald nunzio apostolico in Egitto e delegato presso la Lega degli Stati Arabi, incarico che ha ricoperto fino all’ottobre 2012. La nomina è stata una sorpresa, in quanto Fitzgerald non aveva una formazione da diplomatico vaticano. Alcuni osservatori l’hanno vista come un uso strategico del suo background in studi arabi e islamici, mentre altri l’hanno vista come una messa in disparte di una figura di spicco nel dialogo interreligioso, in quanto il suo approccio al tema era in contrasto con quello di Benedetto XVI. Dopo il suo servizio diplomatico, Fitzgerald ha risieduto a Gerusalemme e successivamente si è trasferito a Liverpool. Il cardinale è autore di numerosi libri e articoli sul dialogo tra le religioni. Nel 2022, è stato insignito dell ‘OBE (Ufficiale dell’Ordine dell’Impero Britannico) dalla Regina Elisabetta II per i suoi servizi alle partnership interreligiose e interconfessionali.

He began his religious education at St. Francis Xavier Minor Seminary in Singapore in 1967 and later studied theology at the College General in Penang. He was ordained as a priest for the Diocese of Melaka-Johor on July 28, 1977, at the age of 26. Throughout his career, Francis has held various positions within the Church. He served as a parish vicar, professor of dogmatic theology, spiritual director, and chaplain for university students. He also earned a licentiate in dogmatic theology from the Pontifical University of St Thomas Aquinas in Rome in 1983 and a degree in justice and peace studies from the Maryknoll School of Theology in New York. On July 7, 2012, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Francis as the fifth bishop of the Diocese of Penang. He was consecrated on August 20, 2012, at St Anne’s Church in Bukit Mertajam, with 10,000 Catholics witnessing the event. In his role as Bishop of Penang, Francis has worked to elevate the status of St. Anne’s Church in Bukit Mertajam to a minor basilica, recognizing its significance as a pilgrimage site that attracts 250,000 Catholics and non-Catholics annually. Francis has held several important positions within the Catholic hierarchy. He served as president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Malaysia, Singapore, and Brunei from 2016 to 2023. In 2023, he was appointed chairman of the Office of Social Communication of the Federation of Asian Bishops’ Conferences. Pope Francis elevated Bishop Francis to the rank of cardinal on September 30, 2023, making him only the second cardinal from Malaysia. The Malaysian bishop has been a strong advocate of intercultural and interreligious dialogue, and served as vice-president of the Malaysian Consultative Council for Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Sikhism and Taoism. In Malaysia where 60% of the population are Muslim, Cardinal Francis refuses to describe Catholics as a “minority.” In an interview with the Missions Étrangères de Paris, he said that “divisions between majority and minority, liberal and conservative, or right and left are not appropriate in the Asian context.” Cardinal Francis has also been a promoter of the controversial Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace and Living Together, co-signed by Pope Francis and the Grand Imam of Al-Azhar in 2019. “This document always helps to break the ice” with representatives of other religions, he has said. Cardinal Sebastian Francis supports stronger engagement with China and has shown interest in increasing China’s participation in the Federation of Asian Bishops’ Conferences (FABC). Although he has not referred to it directly, he also appears to have a generally positive view of the contentious Vatican-China agreement. He has stated that the Pope “shares so much the Asian psyche, the Asian ethos, and the Asian culture.” Cardinal Francis is a keen supporter of synodality; he has said he advocates studying “burning issues” and believes the Church is not “afraid of any agendas on the part of anyone.” He is known to speak English, Malay, and Tamil.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Sebastian Francis emphasizes intercultural dialogue and collaboration, advocating for engagement with diverse religious communities and promoting the Document on Human Fraternity for World Peace.

87,Mauro Gambetti,"Cardinal Mauro Gambetti is a Conventual Franciscan and former Custos General of the General Custody of the Sacred Convent of Saint Francis in Assisi who since 2021 has served as Archpriest of St. Peter’s Basilica. Born on October 27, 1965, in Castel San Pietro Terme, Bologna, Italy, Gambetti began his journey by obtaining a degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Bologna before entering the Order of Friars Minor Conventual. Gambetti professed temporary vows in 1995 and perpetual vows in 1998. After completing his bachelor’s degree in theology from the Theological Institute of Assisi, Gambetti earned a licentiate in theological anthropology from the Theological Faculty of Central Italy in Florence. He was ordained as a priest on January 8, 2000, in Longiano, Forlì-Cesena. Gambetti’s career has been marked by several significant appointments. From 2005 to 2009, he served as the Guardian of the Franciscan community at the Convent of the Santissimo Crocifisso. In 2009, he was elected Provincial Minister of the Bologna province of Saint Anthony of Padua, overseeing the convents of the Friars Minor Conventual in Emilia-Romagna. A major milestone in Gambetti’s career came in 2013 when he was appointed Custos General of the General Custody of the Sacred Convent of Saint Francis in Assisi, a position he held until 2020. During this time, he also served as the Episcopal Vicar for the pastoral care of the Papal Basilica of Saint Francis in Assisi. On November 28, 2020, Pope Francis elevated Gambetti to cardinal and the following February appointed him Archpriest of St. Peter’s Basilica, Vicar General of His Holiness for Vatican City State, and President of the Fabric of Saint Peter’s. In a more recent development, on June 2, 2023, Pope Francis appointed Cardinal Gambetti as a judge of the Vatican City State Supreme Court, effective from January 1, 2024. Cardinal Gambetti, whom Pope Francis got to know during papal visits to Assisi, is the first Conventual Franciscan to be made a cardinal since 1861. At the time of his appointment, Gambetti was one of the youngest men to be elevated to the College of Cardinals, having just turned 55. During his tenure as Archpriest of St. Peter’s Basilica, Gambetti has witnessed and been involved in several controversies. In 2021, soon after taking over as archpriest from Cardinal Angelo Comastri, he played a key role in clarifying and modifying a highly controversial ban on private Masses in St. Peter’s Basilica that had been ordered by the Secretariat of State.  Gambetti emphasized that the exceptions he had allowed to the ban should not become the norm, “distorting the intentions and the sense of the Magisterium.” On celebration of the Vetus Ordo (Old Latin Mass) in the basilica which had been severely limited under the ban, Gambetti said that “everything possible must be done to fulfill the wishes of the faithful and priests as foreseen by the Motu Proprio Summorum Pontificum.”   However, since 2023 and in light of Traditionis Custodes, he has not allowed participants of a traditional annual pilgrimage to celebrate their old rite Mass in the basilica, limiting them only to a short liturgy. In August 2021, Cardinal Gambetti drew criticism when he had the Altar of St. Joseph in the basilica turned versus populum, removing the altar rail and obstructing the relics of Sts. Simon and Jude who are reputed to be buried there. The cardinal has also faced further criticism for his management of the basilica, including that the new statutes and regulations Gambetti had introduced had led to the unexpected and unfair dismissals of some senior canons of the basilica. As cardinal archpriest, in early 2023 Gambetti arranged for Benedict XVI to lie in state in the basilica and also arranged Cardinal George Pell’s funeral at the Altar of the Chair.  He has also supervised the successful and well-received renovation of some areas of the basilica including Bernini’s baldacchino covering the basilica’s main altar.

88,Juan de la Caridad García Rodríguez,"Cardinal Juan de la Caridad García Rodríguez, Archbishop of San Cristóbal de la Habana, is a Cuban prelate known for his outreach to the poor, other social justice initiatives, missionary spirit, and innovative approach to catechesis. Born on July 11, 1948, in Camagüey, Cuba, to a modest family, the first of six children, García Rodríguez was still an adolescent when he entered the San Basilio Magno seminary in El Cobre. For a year he attended the El Buen Pastor seminary in Havana and then completed his theological formation in the San Carlos y San Ambrosio seminary, again in the capital. He was part of the first group of Cuban priests to complete their entire priestly formation within Cuba and was ordained as a priest on January 25, 1972. Garcia Rodriguez began his ministry in parishes that are now part of the Ciego de Ávila Diocese. His early years in the priesthood were marked by his dedication to evangelization, often going from house to house to distribute leaflets reaffirming Christian principles, despite the restrictions imposed by the Castro regime. In the mid-1990s, he co-wrote a popular devotionary, Los cubanos rezamos a Dios (Cubans Pray to God), as well as founded and headed the Escuela para Misioneros de la Diócesis (School for Missionaries of the Diocese). In 1997, he was appointed as an auxiliary bishop of Camagüey, and in 2002, he became the Archbishop of Camagüey. During his tenure in Camagüey, he initiated several notable projects, including the revitalization of the San Agustín seminary and the development of numerous works serving the poorest members of society. One of García Rodríguez’s most significant achievements has been his innovative approach to catechesis in Cuba. He developed evangelization programs that enlisted grandparents, who still remembered their Catholic education from childhood, to teach the principles of Catholicism to their grandchildren. This approach proved effective in a society where religious practice had been discouraged for decades. In 2016, Pope Francis appointed García Rodríguez as the Archbishop of Havana, succeeding Cardinal Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino. His appointment was notable enough to be reported in Granma, the official newspaper of the Communist Party of Cuba. García Rodríguez has held several important positions within the Cuban Catholic Church. He served as the president of the Cuban Conference of Catholic Bishops from 2006 to 2010, and represented Cuba at the fifth general assembly of Latin American and Caribbean bishops in Aparecida, Brazil, in 2007. On October 5, 2019, Pope Francis elevated García Rodríguez to the rank of cardinal. Throughout his career, García Rodríguez has been known for his humble nature, missionary spirit, and commitment to social justice. He has worked to establish prison ministries and has been actively involved in helping Cubans during times of natural disasters, such as Hurricane Ike in 2008. Cardinal García Rodríguez was personally chosen by Pope Francis to take part in the 2023 and 2024 assemblies of the Synod on Synodality. At the 2023 assembly, he said of his experience: “We have felt the passage of the Holy Spirit in this process of continuity thanks to Pope Francis.”","• Theology/Ideology: García Rodríguez advocates for social justice and innovative catechesis, emphasizing outreach to marginalized communities.

89,Gianfranco Ghirlanda,"Cardinal Gianfranco Ghirlanda is an Italian Jesuit and Pope Francis’ most trusted canonist who has played a significant role in shaping recent controversial Church reforms. Born on July 5, 1942, in Rome, Ghirlanda has had a long and distinguished career closely associated with the Pontifical Gregorian University. He served as a professor of canon law at the university and later became its rector. Pope Francis has come to depend on him for his canonical expertise, with some saying he has become the “intellectual powerhouse” driving many of Francis’ institutional legal reforms in recent years. One of Ghirlanda’s most notable contributions has been his work on the reform of the Roman Curia. He provided the legal philosophy underpinning Pope Francis’ reforms, arguing for a maximalist interpretation of the roles open to lay people in Church governance. Ghirlanda controversially asserted that “the power of governance in the Church doesn’t come from the sacrament of Holy Orders, but from the canonical mission.” This position has sparked debate among theologians and canonists, with some arguing that it contradicts established Church teachings on the link between sacramental ordination and governance. Ghirlanda’s influence extended to the constitutional reform of the Vatican City State, where his school of thought was evident in rooting all governing authority directly in the pope. He also played a crucial role in drafting the new constitution for the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. In recognition of his contributions, Pope Francis elevated Ghirlanda to the rank of cardinal in 2022, despite his advanced age of 79 at the time. This appointment was seen as an endorsement of Ghirlanda’s canonical approach and his importance to the Pope’s vision of reform. He was one of the few men to be given a red hat as a priest without first being consecrated as a bishop. Most recently, on June 19, 2023, Pope Francis appointed Cardinal Ghirlanda the new cardinal patron of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. This position, which is responsible for the spiritual welfare of the order, is seen as both a reward for his work and a way to ensure his continued influence in interpreting the order’s new constitutional structure. Although Ghirlanda was not explicitly mentioned as drafting specific changes to Opus Dei’s governance — changes that significantly altered the structure of the personal prelature in 2022 — his theological and canonical perspectives appear to have significantly influenced the overall direction of the reforms. Ghirlanda also likely influenced recent reforms applied to the Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. The changes explicitly promote liturgical renewal according to Vatican II and encourage inculturated liturgies. This orientation indirectly challenges the preference for the Vetus Ordo. While there have been unconfirmed reports about Ghirlanda’s involvement in potential changes to conclave rules, both Ghirlanda and the Vatican press office have denied these claims.","• Theology/Ideology: Ghirlanda advocates for a maximalist interpretation of lay governance in the Church, emphasizing that canonical mission, rather than sacramental ordination, is the source of authority.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his intellectual rigor and deep understanding of canon law, he possesses a diplomatic approach that has garnered trust from Pope Francis and other reform-minded clerics.  
• Power Base: His close relationship with Pope Francis and his role in significant Church reforms have solidified his influence within the Vatican and among progressive factions in the Church.  
• Core Motivation: Ghirlanda is driven by a vision of reform that seeks to modernize the Church's governance structures and enhance the role of laypeople within ecclesiastical authority.","Cardinal Gianfranco Ghirlanda is recognized for his strong advocacy of lay governance within the Church, emphasizing that authority is derived from canonical mission rather than sacramental ordination.

90,William Seng Chye Goh,"Cardinal William Goh Seng Chye is a conservative-leaning Archbishop of Singapore who became the first prelate of his country to be elevated to the College of Cardinals. Born on 25 June 1957 in Singapore, Goh was raised in a Catholic family that he says wasn’t particularly devout except for his mother but as a child he felt more drawn to the faith and devotional practices. After attending Montfort Junior School and Montfort Secondary School in Hougang, where he received his high school diploma, Goh began his philosophy studies at the Major Seminary at Penang (College General), and theology at the St. Francis Xavier Major Seminary (SFXMS) of Singapore. He was ordained a priest of the archdiocese of Singapore in 1985. After ordination, he first served as parish vicar of Holy Cross in Singapore (1985-1990). From 1990 to 1992 he studied for his licentiate in theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He then served as assistant parish priest at the Church of Holy Cross in Singapore, then as parish priest at Saint Anne’s parish, Singapore (1992-1993) and as professor and formator at the Major Seminary of Singapore (1992-2005). Since 2005, he has held the role of rector of Singapore Major Seminary. He has also held the following positions: member of the Presbyteral Senate, member of the College of Consultors, member of the Diocesan Council for Vocational Promotion, and spiritual director of the Archdiocesan Catholic Center for Spirituality. On 29 December 2012, he was appointed coadjutor archbishop of Singapore by Pope Benedict XVI. On 20 May 2013, Pope Francis appointed him archbishop of Singapore. In May 2022, Pope Francis announced that then Archbishop William Goh would be one of 21 new cardinals, making him the first Cardinal from Singapore. Cardinal Goh was created a cardinal on 27 August 2022 in St Peter’s Basilica. He was awarded the titular church of Santa Maria “Regina Pacis” in Ostia mare. Cardinal Goh is known for his emphasis on interreligious harmony, inclusivity, and the importance of engaging with the youth and marginalized communities. He has reaffirmed Church doctrine on sexual ethics, while showing openness to pastoral treatment of those who struggle to fully live up to Church teachings. He has embraced the Synod on Synodality, while frankly criticizing some aspects of it. His diocesan leadership has been largely uncontroversial and his dealings with governments cautious, emphasizing the separation of Church and State. Goh has generally steered clear of entering into contemporary disputes, such as women priests and priestly celibacy. He has fervently presented a model of positive cooperation and interreligious harmony across Asia, and at the same time encourages Catholics to be proud of their Catholic faith and staunch defenders of it. Cardinal Goh stresses the importance of evangelization and leading people to an encounter with Christ thorough sound formation in doctrine and the liturgy, and a devout use of the sacraments. He has supported the Traditional Latin Mass in his diocese and advocated Communion on the tongue. His views on homosexuality were initially firm but appear to have softened over the past decade, partly due to compromises he believed were necessary in resisting the repeal of Singapore’s anti-sodomy laws. While Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle is considered a leading Asian contender to succeed Pope Francis, Cardinal William Goh, who is almost exactly the same age, has emerged as another strong contender from the continent where the Church is growing in importance. In recent years, Goh has been unafraid to voice his differences with Pope Francis (for example on Amoris Laetitia and reception of the Eucharist), showing himself to be fairly conservative and less tied to Pope Francis’ legacy than Cardinal Tagle. His general stance on a variety of issues could make him a crucial bridge-builder after the entrenched divisions of the Francis pontificate.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Goh is a conservative leader who emphasizes traditional Church teachings while also advocating for pastoral approaches to complex issues.

91,Arlindo Gomes Furtado,"Cardinal Arlindo Gomes Furtado is the Church’s first cardinal from Cape Verde who has focused on social justice issues and called for a welcoming Church that is “more dynamic in its evangelization.” Born on November 15, 1949, in Figueira das Naus, Santa Catarina, Cape Verde, Furtado began his journey in the Church at a young age. He completed his primary education in Achada Lem and his secondary education at the Seminary of São José in Praia by 1962. He then pursued theological studies in Coimbra, Portugal, from 1971 to 1976. After returning to Cape Verde, he was ordained as a deacon on May 9, 1976, and shortly after, on July 18, 1976, he was ordained as a priest. Following his ordination, Furtado served as a parish vicar and later as the rector of the Seminary of São José from 1978 to 1986. His then went to Rome, where he earned a licentiate in biblical science from the Pontifical Biblical Institute. Furtado’s academic prowess was further demonstrated when he taught Greek, Hebrew, History, and Biblical Geography at the Theological Studies Institute in Coimbra from 1991 to 1995. In 1995 he returned to Cape Verde and began working in parish ministry and serving as member of the National Council for Education and taught in the Police Academy. Until 2004 he was also vicar general of the diocese of Santiago de Cabo Verde. Furtado’s leadership in the Church was recognized when Pope John Paul II appointed him as the first bishop of the newly created Diocese of Mindelo on December 9, 2003. His abilities as a leader were further acknowledged when Pope Benedict XVI named him Bishop of the Santiago Diocese on July 22, 2009. Pope Francis elevated Furtado to the sacred college on January 4, 2015, making him the first cardinal from Cape Verde. Following his elevation to the cardinalate, Furtado was quickly appointed to several important positions within the Vatican. He became a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and the Pontifical Council Cor Unum in 2015. The following year he was made a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. Commenting on the 2015 Synod on the Family, Cardinal Furtado emphasized the importance of strong family ties and the family as the foundation for faith and society. He criticized individualism and urged the strengthening of family bonds, saying the family is vital for building the Church of the future. The Cardinal has expressed concern about poverty, unemployment, and violence in Cape Verde. “Poverty and the rise of unemployment often lead to increased violence, and that is of great concern to us,” he has said. He also has expressed his desire for a Church that is “more dynamic in its evangelization” and hopes for a Church that can address sensitive issues with a “Mother’s heart.” As a cardinal from Cape Verde, Furtado, like many of Pope Francis choices of cardinals, brings a perspective from the global South to the College of Cardinals.

93,Oswald Gracias,"Cardinal Oswald Gracias, the Archbishop Emeritus of Bombay, has held many significant leadership positions in the Church including serving on Pope Francis’ nine-member Council of Cardinal Advisers but who latterly has faced accusations of mishandling abuse cases. Born on December 24, 1944, in Mahim, Mumbai, India, after being ordained priest on December 20, 1970, he obtained a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Urbaniana University and a diploma in jurisprudence from the Pontifical Gregorian University. His early career included roles such as chancellor and secretary to the Bishop of Jamshedpur, parochial vicar, and secretary to the Archbishop of Bombay as well as chancellor of the same diocese. Gracias’ ascent in the Church hierarchy began with his appointment as titular Bishop of Bladia and Auxiliary of Bombay in 1997. He was later appointed Archbishop of Agra in 2000 before becoming the Archbishop of Bombay in 2006. His most significant elevation came on November 24, 2007, when Pope Benedict XVI created him a cardinal. In 2008 in Washington, D.C., Gracias underwent surgery for a rare form of cancer. He recovered completely. Throughout his career, Cardinal Gracias has held numerous leadership positions within the Catholic Church. He served as the President of the Conference of Catholic Bishops of India (CCBI) and the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India (CBCI). In 2012 he was elected Secretary General of the Federation of Asian Bishops’ Conferences. A year later he was elected its president and held that position until the end of 2018. Cardinal Gracias participated in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis, and in the same year, Francis selected him as a member of the Council of Cardinals, a group established to advise the Pope and study plans for reforming the Roman Curia. He was also mentioned as a possible candidate for the papacy during the previous conclave. In 2017, Pope Francis granted him the title of Lawyer of the Roman Rota, further recognizing his expertise in canon law. Despite his numerous achievements, Cardinal Gracias has faced controversy. In 2019, he was accused of failing to respond adequately to allegations of sexual abuse within the Church. According to a BBC report, he may have violated India’s Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO) by failing to report abuse allegations to the police. In a separate incident, Cardinal Gracias was recorded in a phone conversation with Bishop Kannikadass William Antony, who was accused of fathering a child. In this conversation, Gracias allegedly suggested arranging a paternity test at a Catholic hospital to “control the media, control the doctors, control the publicity given to the whole thing.” This has been interpreted as an attempt to manage the scandal rather than address it transparently. Cardinal Gracias admitted that he “could have handled sexual abuse cases better.” The full resolution of these cases and any potential consequences for Cardinal Gracias are still developing. The Indian cardinal has taken a strong pro-life stance against abortion. He led a “March for Life” in Pune, Maharashtra to protest India’s abortion law. Cardinal Gracias, along with other participants, submitted a memorandum supporting the rights of the unborn to local authorities. In 2011, he expressed his relief at the Indian Supreme Court’s decision to reject the plea for the mercy killing of a nurse who was in a semi-comatose condition for over three decades. The cardinal said that “allowing one to die amounts to actively supporting taking away one’s life.” Like many Indian prelates, he views climate change as a major issue that needs to be addressed. He has signed documents calling for action against climate change and stated that the Church cannot rest until “the Paris agreement is fulfilled, adhered to and followed up.” He sees climate change as closely linked to issues like deforestation, illegal mining, and ecological impact. Cardinal Gracias believes synodality is the way forward for the Catholic Church. He sees it as a natural development arising from ecclesiology and theology, emphasizing the baptismal responsibility of all believers and the need for an inclusive, participatory church. However, he acknowledges there may be “roadblocks” to implementing synodality, similar to challenges faced after Vatican II. In 2019, the cardinal suggested that a pathway to married priests is still an open possibility. And during the 2019 Synod of Bishops he suggested in his intervention that following present canon law could present possibilities for married men to be ordained to the priesthood, mentioning that special dispensations could be granted. On migration, he recognizes its complex nature and has noted that in Asia, migration is often viewed as both advantageous for local economies and a potential “brain-drain.” The Catholic Bishops’ Conference of India, under his leadership, has launched initiatives to support migrants, recognizing the Church’s “duty to accompany migrants.” Cardinal Gracias has also emphasized the importance of migrants for urban economies and construction. Regarding restrictions on the vetus ordo, Cardinal Gracias briefly mentioned Traditionis Custodes in an interview, stating that there have been “only really tiny pockets of resistance [to the decree] but nothing much in Asia,” unlike in North American and some other Western countries. On January 25, 2025, Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Cardinal Gracias as Archbishop of Bombay.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Gracias advocates for a pro-life stance and emphasizes the importance of synodality within the Church, viewing it as essential for inclusivity and participation.

94,Mario Grech,"Cardinal Mario Grech, a former Bishop of Gozo, is a controversial Maltese bishop who has rapidly risen up the hierarchy to head the Vatican secretariat responsible for running Vatican synods. Born on February 20, 1957, in Qala, Malta, Grech completed his primary and secondary education at Victoria Lyceum in Gozo before studying philosophy and theology at the Gozo diocesan seminary. After his ordination as a priest on May 26, 1984, Grech pursued higher education in Rome, obtaining a licentiate in Utroque Iure (civil and canon law) from the Pontifical Lateran University and a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas. Upon returning to Malta, he served in various pastoral roles and held several diocesan positions, including Judicial Vicar and teacher of canon law. On November 26, 2005, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Grech as Bishop of Gozo, a position he held until 2019 when Pope Francis hand-picked Grech to be Secretary General of the Synod of Bishops, a position he took up in September 2020. Francis elevated the Maltese prelate to the rank of cardinal on November 28, 2020. As Secretary General of the Synod, Grech has become a central figure in the ongoing Synod on Synodality, championing the concept of a “synodal Church” and playing a crucial role in shaping the future direction of the Church under Pope Francis. He has been praised by supporters for leading the charge in implementing what they view as a more consultative and inclusive approach to Church governance. Critics have said he is the footsoldier of a process which undermines episcopal authority and the hierarchical order of the Church. As Secretary General he has got to know, and become known by, a significant portion of the cardinal electors and has become, more than anyone else, the emblem of the synodal path. In March, he announced an “Accompaniment Process of the Implementation Phase of the Synod on Synodality” that will culminate in October 2028, not in a synod of bishops but in an “ecclesial assembly” where the “People of God,” made up of roughly equal numbers of bishops, clergy, religious and laypeople, will propose perspectives “for the entire Church.” The innovation was a notable departure from the previous assemblies of the Synod on Synodality where the majority of the votes were cast by bishops. Cardinal Gerhard Müller and others criticized the introduction of such an assembly, arguing that it was giving the laity the same authority as bishops and potentially changing the sacramental order of the Church. Cardinal Grech has to date not responded to these concerns. During much of his time as Bishop of Gozo, Grech was known for his conservative stance on certain issues, such as opposing the legalization of divorce in Malta in 2011, and stressing that those who do not follow Catholic teaching should not receive Communion. A significant shift in Grech’s approach occurred following Pope Francis’ election in 2013 and the election of a leftist government in Malta. He began to embrace a more progressive approach, as particularly evidenced in his statements during the 2014 Synod on the Family. Grech claimed at that time that the catechism’s language on homosexuality was hurtful to homosexuals, and some years later, Grech defended Pope Francis’ endorsement of same-sex civil unions, describing the controversy around it as “a storm in a teacup.” These comments contrasted with 2008 comments he had made during Benedict XVI’s pontificate when he had stated that those such as LGBT individuals who don’t accept Church teachings should excommunicate themselves. However, his position against abortion has reportedly not changed. His supporters on the progressive wing of the Church say his shifting opinions on these issues shows his capacity for growth and change. Although he has not taken a public stance on celebrations in the Vetus Ordo, the Maltese community associated with the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite claims that the then-Bishop of Gozo did not actively support the implementation of Summorum Pontificum in the diocese. According to reports, “several requests for Mass in the extraordinary form of the Roman Rite since 2007 were met with silence or refusals” in Gozo. In 2017, Grech became embroiled in a controversy over guidelines by Malta’s bishops on Chapter 8 of Pope Francis’ post-synodal apostolic exhortation Amoris Laetitia. The Maltese cardinal was regarded as the principal author of the contentious guidelines, otherwise known as “Maltese directive,” which critics said went further than the exhortation on allowing civilly remarried divorcees to Holy Communion and contradicted previous papal teaching on the matter.1 Grech responded by saying the guidelines were not opposed to the Magisterium, and urged reading them “as they are” rather than what had been written about them in the media. He was nevertheless accused of using heavy-handed tactics in implementing the guidelines. He refuted the accusation but Grech had been accused of such actions before, most notably in a 2014 letter that a group of Maltese priests sent to Cardinal Reinhard Marx, then head of the Commission of the Bishops’ Conferences of the European Community. During his time in Malta, one of the countries most affected by the flow of migrants, he used very strong language towards Europe, particularly criticizing political leaders who sought to hinder the activities of NGO ships. On this issue, Grech also harshly criticized a segment of Maltese society, accusing it of “racism,” and condemning Europe’s actions as “criminal.” More recently, he has continued to be at the center of some controversies, particularly regarding statements he has made on sensitive topics. In 2022, he denounced 85 bishops who had criticized the divisive German Synodal Way, calling their criticism “unhelpful” and “polarizing” while expressing confidence that the German synodal leaders “know what they are doing.” In the same year, he said of synodality that it is characteristic of “a listening Church” and that “we are not taking positions on anything,” leading to criticism that he was advocating a Church that listens but does not teach. In a 2024 interview, he raised further concerns by expressing support for a female diaconate and advocated for greater flexibility in pastoral approaches across different regions. However, unlike his predecessor at the synod secretariat, the cardinal has been open and willing to field questions critical of the Synod on Synodality, such as the concern that it might be being used as a vehicle to undermine Catholic teaching and be a form of “Protestantization” of the Church.2 Overall, despite the controversies and past criticisms of his governance, he remains a trusted and loyal confidant of Pope Francis with whom he shares a very similar vision for the future of the Church.

95,Wilton Daniel Gregory,"Cardinal Wilton Daniel Gregory, the former Archbishop of Washington D.C., is a progressive prelate and the Church’s first African American cardinal, known for his social justice work especially when it comes to issues of race, same-sex relations, and for his efforts to combat clerical sex abuse. Born on December 7, 1947, in Chicago, Illinois, Gregory is the oldest of three children whose parents later divorced. His journey in the Catholic Church began when he converted at the age of eleven as he was impressed by the priests and teachers at his Catholic grammar school and knew then that he wanted to be a priest. Gregory’s path to priesthood started with his education at Niles College and Saint Mary of the Lake Seminary. He was ordained a priest on May 9, 1973, at the age of 25 and, after serving as an associate pastor, he pursued further studies and earned a doctorate in sacred liturgy from the Pontifical Liturgical Institute in Rome in 1980. Gregory’s ascent in the Church hierarchy was marked by several significant appointments. In 1983, at the age of 36, he became the youngest Catholic bishop in the United States when he was ordained as Auxiliary Bishop of Chicago. He later served as Bishop of Belleville from 1994 to 2004, and as Archbishop of Atlanta from 2005 to 2019. One of Gregory’s most notable achievements was his election as the first African American president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) in 2001. During his tenure, he played a crucial role in addressing the sexual abuse scandal in the U.S. Catholic Church, leading the USCCB in issuing the 2002 “Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People” which established a zero-tolerance policy for priests and deacons who sexually abused minors. Although the Charter had its weaknesses, then-Bishop Gregory’s leadership was widely praised and he was recognized for his ability to engage with survivors, sincerely apologize, and work towards healing and accountability within the Church. Cardinal Gregory served on several USCCB committees and was known for writing extensively on various Church issues. His tenure as USCCB President was marked by efforts to improve the religious life of African American Catholics and address important social and moral issues facing the Church in the United States. In April 2019, Pope Francis appointed Gregory Archbishop of Washington, succeeding Cardinal Donald Wuerl. The following autumn, Pope Francis elevated Gregory to cardinal, making him the first African American to reach this position in the Catholic Church. In 2024, Cardinal Gregory received Rector’s Award at the Pontifical North American College in Rome. Throughout his career, Gregory was known for his work on racial issues within the Church and society at large. In 1984, he co-authored a pastoral letter on evangelism that addressed the unique history of Black Catholics in the United States. The three-page tract asserted that 1.5 million black Catholics in the United States had a unique history which required understanding and culturally sensitive strategies to achieve successful evangelization. In 1987, he published another tract entitled, “The Spirit and Truth: Black Catholic Reflections on the Order of the Mass” that focused on liturgical accommodations. Cardinal Gregory’s views on social issues also closely align with those of Pope Francis. On homosexuality, Gregory has stated that LGBTQ Catholics are welcome in the Church, but that the Church has its rules and teachings on these matters that must be respected. The cardinal has also been a strong advocate of action on climate change, encouraging students to confront the scientific theory in their daily lives and future careers, and launching a “Laudato Si’” action plan for the Archdiocese of Washington to combat climate change through education and practical steps. In addition, Gregory has embraced Pope Francis’ emphasis on synodality, praising the synodal process for allowing people to speak honestly about their hopes and concerns for the Church. He has said he sees synodality as a way to understand “the heart of the Church.” On migration, Cardinal Gregory has called for bipartisan immigration reform and emphasized the Church’s support for immigrants. He views this as an important issue for the Church to address. However, he has been no stranger to controversy. In 2014, Gregory faced criticism for constructing a $2.2 million residence in Atlanta. He subsequently apologized and agreed to sell the property. During the election campaign in 2024, the cardinal made headlines when he was critical of Catholic politicians such as President Biden who support abortion rights while claiming to be devout Catholics. He described this as “cafeteria Catholicism” where people pick and choose which teachings to follow. However, Gregory said he would not deny Communion to Biden over this issue, preferring dialogue instead. His criticisms of President Trump were more frequent and vociferous, partly because they were made in the context of rioting and racial tensions that followed police involvement in the death of George Floyd, a black man, in 2020. Gregory strongly criticized Trump’s visit to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine during that time, calling it “baffling and reprehensible” that a Catholic facility would allow itself to be “so egregiously misused and manipulated.” Gregory also asserted that Trump’s rhetoric had “deepened divisions and diminished our national life” and compared his public criticisms of Trump to clergy who marched in the civil rights movement. Critics said Gregory’s criticisms of Trump were unseemly partisan attacks on the President at a time when the country desperately needed healing and unity. Following Pope Francis’ apostolic letter Traditionis Custodes, Cardinal Gregory took significant steps to strictly limit the celebration of the Vetus Ordo in the Archdiocese of Washington — an area where the old-rite Mass was relatively prevalent and popular, and growing in popularity. The cardinal said that allowing the old form of the Mass is an “exception” and that the post-Vatican II Mass should be “the dominant rite.” Asked why students had no access to the Traditional Latin Mass at Catholic University of America, the cardinal said, “Tradition dies a slow, sometimes bloody death.” Throughout his career, Cardinal Wilton Gregory has sought to break racial barriers in the Catholic Church while addressing challenging issues such as sexual abuse and racial injustice, but he has also been no stranger to criticism and controversy. On January 6, 2025, the Vatican announced that Pope Francis had accepted Cardinal Gregory’s resignation as Archbishop of Washington and appointed as his successor Cardinal Robert Walter McElroy, transferring him to the U.S. capital from the diocese of San Diego. Three weeks after the announcement of Gregory’s retirement, he gave a talk to members of the LGBTQ community at Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Washington, D.C., telling them how “ashamed” he was over the Church’s “increasingly harsh treatment of one another—rejecting people because of race, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic origins, or any other distinctions.” Gregory spoke particularly of “our LGBTQ brothers and sisters” saying the “way we have treated” them “has brought them tears and too many of us disgrace.  “I apologize from the heart for the hurt that has resulted in the loss of so many of our family members who belong to God no less than I do,” he said. “I apologize not only for those whose past actions have scandalized and wounded these men and women. I apologize for my own lack of courage to bring healing and hope, and I ask forgiveness.” Cardinal Gregory is known to speak both English and Spanish.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Gregory is a progressive theologian who emphasizes social justice, inclusivity, and the importance of addressing race and LGBTQ issues within the Church.

96,Claudio Gugerotti,"An academic and polyglot, Cardinal Claudio Gugerotti has never served as a diocesan bishop nor as a seminary rector but spent almost his entire career either in the Vatican or as a papal nuncio. Although he served as a Holy See diplomat for 20 years, his expertise is the Eastern Churches. Born in Verona on 7 October 1955, he joined the Pious Society of Don Nicola Mazza and was ordained a priest on 20 May 1982, for the diocese of Verona. He earned a licentiate in Eastern languages and literature from the Ca’ Foscari University of Venice, as well as a licentiate in liturgy from the Pontifical Saint Anselm Athenaeum, and, in 1996, a doctorate in oriental ecclesiastical sciences from the Pontifical Oriental Institute. Gugerotti taught patristics at the San Zeno Theological Institute in Verona from 1981 to 1984, and theology and Eastern liturgy at the Institute of Ecumenical Studies in Verona from 1982 to 1985. He also taught patristics and the Armenian language and literature at the Pontifical Oriental Institute and was lecturer at universities in Venice, Padua, Rome and at the Pontifical Gregorian University. In 1985, just three years after his ordination, Gugerotti began working in the Congregation for Eastern Churches, the department of the Holy See that oversees the 23 Eastern Churches in communion with Rome, including the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, the Syro-Malabar Church and the Maronite Church. He served as the Congregation’s undersecretary for five years (1997-2001) when Cardinal Achille Silvestrini was its prefect (1991-2000). Gugerotti also served as a member of the Office for the Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff under Pope John Paul II. In this role, he assisted John Paul II in celebrating the Armenian liturgy. Because of his study of Armenia and the Armenian language, in 1988 Gugerotti was invited, as an official of the Congregation, to join a delegation of Caritas Italiana in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake there. He partly credits the trip, which had a considerable impact on him, to the former Vatican Secretary of State Cardinal Agostino Casaroli and the Ostpolitik that Casaroli championed. Appointed an archbishop in 2002, he chose as his motto “By the Eastern Road” and from 2002-2011 he served as apostolic nuncio to three countries of the Eastern Christian tradition: Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. In 2011 Pope Benedict XVI sent Gugerotti to be his representative in Belarus. Pope Francis then appointed him apostolic nuncio in Ukraine, a country that has the largest number of Catholics of the Eastern rite. He served there from 2015 to 2020 amid the ongoing conflict over Crimea. Francis then sent him to be nuncio in Great Britain from 2020 to 2022. In November 2022, Pope Francis named Gugerotti prefect of the Dicastery for the Eastern Churches and chancellor of the Pontifical Oriental Institute. He was later made patron of the institute and Cardinal José Tolentino Mondonça appointed chancellor in his place. Pope Francis elevated Gugerotti to the cardinalate at a consistory on September 30, 2023. The Cardinal speaks Italian, Latin, ancient and modern Greek, Armenian, Kurdish, English, French and Russian. He is author of several books in Italian on the Eastern Churches liturgy and has written numerous essays and articles that bring together his experience and studies on these topics.1 Reflecting his long service in the Roman Curia, Cardinal Gugerotti is a member of several Vatican dicasteries including the Dicastery for Evangelization, the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith; and the Dicastery for Culture and Education. He is also a member of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State, and the Vatican Secretariat of State’s Council of the Section for Relations with States and International Organization. Cardinal Gugerotti is a disciple of the late Cardinal Achille Silvestrini, a controversial figure and leading member of the ‘Sankt Gallen group’ which opposed the election of Pope Benedict XVI, although the extent of his loyalty to the cardinal’s ideas is in doubt. He is also thought to be close to Cardinal Pietro Parolin, also a protégé of Silvestrini. Gugerotti is known for his deep understanding of Eastern Christian traditions and his commitment to fostering dialogue between different Christian communities. His tenure as a nuncio in countries like Ukraine and Belarus has given him firsthand experience with the challenges faced by Eastern Churches, especially in regions affected by political instability and conflict. He has tended to avoid the limelight, refraining from publicly commenting on controversies and so remaining something of a dark horse. However, he has been vocal about the misuse of religion for political gain, emphasizing the need for faith to remain genuine and not become a tool for propaganda. His approach is rooted in a profound respect for the traditions of the Eastern Churches and a commitment to peace and reconciliation. Gugerotti’s career reflects a dedication to bridging gaps between Eastern and Western Christian traditions and supporting communities in challenging environments. His work continues to have a significant impact on the Catholic Church’s relationship with Eastern Christian communities worldwide.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Gugerotti emphasizes a deep respect for Eastern Christian traditions and advocates for dialogue between different Christian communities.

97,James Michael Harvey,"Cardinal James Michael Harvey is a discreet, conservative-leaning American Vatican diplomat and former long-serving prefect of the Pontifical Household who currently serves as Archpriest of the Papal Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls. Born on October 20, 1949, in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, he studied at the seminary in his hometown before being sent to complete his formation in Rome. While living at the Pontifical North American College he obtained a Licentiate in Sacred Theology and graduated in Canon Law at the Pontifical Gregorian University. His ecclesiastical career began when he was ordained as a priest by Pope Paul VI in Rome on June 29, 1975. In 1980, Cardinal Harvey entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See, initially serving for two years in the papal representation of the Dominican Republic before beginning his service in the Secretariat of State in 1982. His career progressed rapidly, with notable appointments including prelate of honor to His Holiness and councilor of the Secretariat of State for General Affairs. Pope John Paul II appointed him prefect of the Papal Household in 1998, consecrating him titular Bishop of Memphis and fifteen years later elevating him to titular Archbishop of Memphis. In November 2012, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Harvey as Archpriest of the Papal Basilica of St. Paul Outside the Walls and elevated him to cardinal shortly afterwards. His appointment to the basilica followed the 2012 Vatileaks scandal when confidential documents were leaked from the Vatican, causing significant embarrassment to the Holy See. Cardinal Harvey was not personally implicated in the leaks, but a member of Harvey’s staff in the Pontifical Household was convicted of stealing documents and sharing them with the media. Cardinal Harvey was a highly regarded prefect of the Pontifical Household, a crucial position responsible for managing various aspects of the Pope’s official duties and the Vatican’s administrative functions. He became a trusted and loyal confidant to both Pope John Paul II and Benedict XVI, serving in the role for twenty-four years. The American cardinal is known for having conservative views on the Church, but he declines media interviews or speaks in public away from the pulpit, and so his opinions on current issues are largely unknown. Cardinal Harvey is a member of the Knights of Columbus and an honorary member of the Circolo San Pietro. He has received several decorations, including the Gran Cruz de la Real Orden de Isabel la Católica of Spain and the Cavalierato di Gran Croce dell’Ordine del Merito of the Italian Republic.

98,Julián Herranz Casado,"Il Cardinale Julián Herranz Casado è un prelato spagnolo dell’Opus Dei ed ex presidente del Pontificio Consiglio per i Testi Legislativi, riconosciuto come uno dei maggiori esperti di diritto canonico della Chiesa. Nato il 31 marzo 1930 a Baena, in Spagna, si è unito all’Opus Dei nel 1949 ed è stato ordinato sacerdote il 7 agosto 1955. Il background accademico di Herranz è impressionante, con dottorati in medicina conseguiti presso le Università di Barcellona e Navarra, nonché una laurea in diritto canonico conseguita presso la Pontificia Università di San Tommaso d’Aquino a Roma. La sua carriera nella Chiesa è iniziata insegnando diritto canonico all’Università di Navarra e viaggiando in tutto il mondo per l’Opus Dei. Nel 1960, ha iniziato a lavorare per la Curia romana, dove ha servito come assistente durante il Concilio Vaticano II (1962-1965). L’esperienza di Herranz nel diritto canonico lo ha portato a essere nominato Segretario della Pontificia Commissione per l’Interpretazione Autentica del Codice di Diritto Canonico nel 1984. Il 15 dicembre 1990, Papa Giovanni Paolo II ha nominato Herranz vescovo titolare di Vertara e ha ricevuto la consacrazione episcopale il 6 gennaio 1991. Il suo ruolo in Vaticano ha continuato a crescere e il 19 dicembre 1994 è stato elevato ad arcivescovo e nominato Presidente del Pontificio Consiglio per i Testi Legislativi. Nel 2003, Papa Giovanni Paolo II lo ha creato Cardinale-Diacono di S. Eugenio. Come cardinale, è stato membro di diverse importanti congregazioni e consigli vaticani, tra cui la Congregazione per la Dottrina della Fede e il Pontificio Consiglio per i Laici. Nel corso della sua carriera, il Cardinale Herranz è stato riconosciuto come uno dei maggiori esperti di diritto canonico. È stato presidente del Pontificio Consiglio per i Testi Legislativi fino al 15 febbraio 2007. La sua influenza si è estesa al di là dei suoi ruoli ufficiali, in quanto si ritiene che facesse parte di un piccolo gruppo di cardinali che hanno guidato la Curia nei periodi in cui Papa Giovanni Paolo II era inabile per malattia. Il Cardinale Herranz ha servito sotto sei Papi, da Giovanni XXIII a Francesco. Ha partecipato al conclave papale del 2005 e, sebbene non fosse considerato un forte candidato al papato, era visto come un potenziale ‘kingmaker’ grazie alle sue conoscenze e alla sua influenza. Nel 2012, Papa Benedetto XVI ha nominato il Cardinale Herranz a presiedere una commissione di indagine sullo scandalo Vatileaks. Insieme ai Cardinali Jozef Tomko e Salvatore De Giorgi, ha condotto un’indagine interna approfondita che andava oltre la ristretta portata criminale delle fughe di notizie. La commissione ha intervistato numerosi funzionari vaticani, compresi altri cardinali, e ha avuto ampia autorità per raccogliere informazioni. Ha raccolto le sue scoperte in un dossier completo di 300 pagine, che è stato presentato direttamente a Papa Benedetto XVI il 17 dicembre 2012. Questo rapporto era altamente confidenziale e il suo contenuto completo era noto solo al Papa e ai cardinali investigatori. L’indagine di Herranz avrebbe scoperto prove di corruzione, lotte di potere e potenziali ricatti all’interno del Vaticano. Alcune fonti hanno affermato che il rapporto ha rivelato l’esistenza di fazioni e lobby all’interno della Curia romana, tra cui una presumibilmente “unita dall’orientamento sessuale”. Tuttavia, lo stesso Herranz si è astenuto dal discutere pubblicamente i dettagli del rapporto, affermando che il Papa è “l’unica persona a cui abbiamo riferito su questa questione”. Il 12 giugno 2014, Papa Francesco ha promosso Herranz da cardinale-diacono a cardinale-sacerdote. Nel giugno 2023, Herranz ha pubblicato “Due Papi“, le sue memorie sulla collaborazione con i Papi Benedetto XVI e Francesco.

99,Jean-Claude Hollerich,"Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich is one of the leading prelates of Francis’ pontificate — a distinctly progressive leaning Jesuit cardinal who spent many years in Japan and in recent years has held a number of influential roles including serving as a member of Francis’ council of advisers, general relator of the Synod on Synodality, and president of the bishops’ conferences of the European Union. Born on August 9, 1958, in Differdange, a Luxembourg village on the very border with France, Jean-Claude grew up in the town of Vianden on the border with Germany, so he learnt both languages from a young age. As a seminarian he studied for three years in Rome where he learnt Italian and took the basic ordination courses in philosophy and theology. A chance meeting with Karl Rahner at breakfast gave Hollerich the opportunity to write to the eminent theologian for book recommendations, since he now wanted to become a professor of doctrinal theology.1 During Hollerich’s Roman years Pope John Paul II was elected, published his programmatic first encyclical Redemptor Hominis, and was shot in St Peter’s Square, but Hollerich does not mention him once in his recollections. The Jesuits, however, were an important reference point: they staffed the Germanicum, where he lived, and ran the Gregorian University, where he studied. In 1981 he joined them. He gives no indication of how aware he was of the state of the Order at the time, marked by heterodox theology, murky morals, opposition to John Paul II and troves of laicizations among their ranks. After the novitiate in Belgium he asked to be sent to Japan and spent four years learning the language and taking courses in theology. To turn these studies into a licentiate before ordination he spent a year at the Jesuit College St Georgen in Germany. After his ordination in Brussels and earmarked for teaching in Japan, he spent four years in Munich studying German language and literature. Asked about his experience with Bavarian Catholicism he said: “In my wider circles I did not meet any believing Catholics.”2 His interest in theology by then had diminished and his impression was “that Catholic theology was much less demanding than other subjects.”3 He returned to Tokyo in 1994 and taught German for 17 years while fulfilling various administrator roles for his order at the Jesuit-run Sophia University. There has been some confusion about his CV. The official Vatican biography of Hollerich somewhat misleadingly states: “In the meantime, in 2001 he carried out his doctoral studies at the Center for European Integration Studies in Bonn, Germany.”4 Curiously, a similarly misleading phrase in the official Vatican biography of Jorge Bergoglio led to it being widely believed that Bergoglio had a German doctorate in theology.5 In truth, Hollerich spent a sabbatical in Germany in 2001, frequenting the Institute of European Studies in Bonn, but he did not complete a doctorate. Likewise, Hollerich was not “Rector of Sophia University in Tokyo” as the Vatican News site suggests, but he was one of five vice rectors and, in his case, rector for international relations. These differences may not seem significant, but none of the misleading additions form part of the biography that was published by the Vatican for his appointment as Archbishop of Luxembourg in 2011. The recent inflation of Hollerich’s academic training and achievements seems to have coincided with him taking up of leadership roles for Pope Francis, who elevated him to the cardinalate in 2019, appointing him to his council of cardinal advisers in 2023, and entrusting him from 2021 to 2024 with leading the Synod on Synodality and drafting its final document. Cardinal Hollerich is unafraid to espouse heterodox views. He favors women deacons and is open to ordaining women as priests. He would like to see the Church effectively change her doctrine to normalize homosexuality; he supports the blessing of homosexual unions, not simply couples as stated in Fiducia Supplicans. For Hollerich, Humanae Vitae should be reassessed in the light of evolving social changes. He is open to relaxing priestly celibacy if it helps solve the priest shortage. He holds to a more Lutheran “priesthood of all believers” idea and seems to deny that priestly ordination confers an “indelible spiritual character.” When it comes to doctrine and pastoral practice, then, the Luxembourg cardinal in many ways encapsulates this pontificate’s direction of travel, but with added verve, radicality and determination. His disdain for those attached to the old rite and conservative Catholicism is irrefutable, although he says he likes the Latin Mass and allows it to continue to be celebrated in his diocese, even in his cathedral. But when it comes to synodality, which he champions and whose global synod on the subject he led, he will listen and include everyone but that group he rejects, despite their flourishing vocations and attendance. As has been the characteristic of all the synods of this pontificate, Hollerich is quick to call on the Holy Spirit — sometimes just “the Spirit” — for guidance or whatever Pope Francis might have discerned and taught. Christ’s words, other challenging passages from Holy Scripture, or previous papal teachings are to be sidelined, ignored or reinterpreted. Condemnation of fornication, for example, is not biblical morality according to Hollerich but rather the remains of an out of date “bourgeois mentality of the nineteenth century.” The Church does not have all the answers, Hollerich believes, and so it is important to become humble, dialogue, and learn from the world rather than turning first to Christ and Revelation. In short, the cardinal is typical of many a modern Jesuit, someone who has strayed from traditional Catholic teaching which he contradicts or questions. Personal discernment and experience are prioritized over Church tradition and authority. But the results of this approach have been disastrous. The Church in Luxembourg is, like the Jesuits, in freefall. A Hollerich pontificate would likely export such a legacy to the universal Church. Since Hollerich is a Jesuit, it seems unlikely he would be considered Pope Francis’ designated successor. But his influence and trusted leadership during the Francis pontificate means he will probably have an important role as kingmaker during the next conclave.","• Theology/Ideology: Hollerich embodies a progressive theological stance, advocating for the normalization of homosexuality and questioning traditional doctrines like Humanae Vitae.

The cardinal strongly supports the Vatican-China provisional agreement on the appointment of bishops contrary to many critics such as his predecessor, Cardinal Joseph Zen-ZeKiun, who fervently oppose it. Born on July 31, 1939, in Hong Kong, Tong Hon began his journey to the priesthood by studying at the Seminário de São José in Macau before earning a master’s degree in philosophy from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Furthering his education, he obtained both a licentiate and a doctorate in dogmatic theology from the Pontifical Urbaniana University. Tong Hon was ordained priest on January 6, 1966. He was appointed vicar general of the Diocese of Hong Kong in December 1992 and his ascent through the Church hierarchy continued with his consecration as auxiliary bishop of Hong Kong on December 9, 1996. In 2008, Pope Benedict XVI named Tong Hon coadjutor bishop of the Hong Kong Diocese, and he assumed the role of Bishop of Hong Kong on April 15, 2009, succeeding Joseph Zen Ze-Kiun. His influence in the Church grew further when he was created Cardinal-Priest of Regina degli Apostoli alla Montagnola on February 18, 2012. This appointment was met with humility by Tong Hon, who expressed feeling “inadequate yet grateful” and viewed it as both “an honor and a responsibility.” Throughout his career, Cardinal Tong Hon has held several significant positions within the Church. He served as a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and the Pontifical Council for Inter Religious Dialogue. In 2012, he was one of three Presidents-General of the Synod of Bishops on the New Evangelization. Notably, he participated in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis.

Born on March 28, 1933, in Yahualica, Jalisco, Mexico, Sandoval grew up in a large Christian family, being the eldest of twelve siblings. At the young age of twelve, he entered the Guadalajara seminary in 1945, marking the beginning of his ecclesiastical journey. In 1952, Sandoval was sent to Rome to continue his studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University. After eight years of rigorous study, he obtained a degree in philosophy and a doctorate in dogmatic theology. His academic achievements culminated in a thesis on “The theology of preaching in St John of Avila.” Sandoval was ordained priest on October 27, 1957, on the solemnity of Christ the King. Returning to Guadalajara in 1961, Sandoval took on various roles at the diocesan seminary, including spiritual director, Prefect of Discipline, and teacher in the Faculty of Philosophy. His leadership qualities were recognized, and he was appointed vice-rector of the Guadalajara seminary in 1971, eventually becoming rector in 1980. Sandoval’s ecclesiastical career continued to flourish. On March 3, 1988, he was appointed coadjutor Bishop of Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, and received his episcopal ordination on April 30 of the same year. He became the Bishop of Ciudad Juárez on July 11, 1992. A significant milestone in Sandoval’s career came on April 21, 1994, when Pope John Paul II appointed him Archbishop of Guadalajara. Later that year, on November 26, 1994, he was created and proclaimed Cardinal by Pope John Paul II, with the title of Nostra Signora di Guadalupe e S. Filippo martire in Via Aurelia. Throughout his tenure, Cardinal Sandoval participated in important Church events, including the conclaves that elected Pope Benedict XVI in 2005 and Pope Francis in 2013. He served as Archbishop of Guadalajara until his retirement on December 7, 2011, at the age of 78. In 1997, he served as general relator of the Special Assembly for America of the Synod of Bishops. Cardinal Sandoval is known for his orthodox views and being forthright in expressing them. He was one of five signatories of a dubia sent to Pope Francis ahead of the Synod on Synodality in 2023 aimed at clarifying the nature of synods and their doctrinal authority. In a candid interview at the time, he emphasized that “a synod does not have doctrinal authority,” raising concerns about the potential implications of granting it such authority. In recent years, Sandoval has been a vocal supporter of the traditional Roman liturgy and urged the Pope not to go through with the restrictions of Traditionis Custodes.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Sandoval Iñiguez is known for his orthodox views and staunch defense of traditional Church teachings.

102,Jorge Enrique Jiménez Carvajal,"Cardinal Jorge Enrique Jiménez Carvajal is Archbishop Emeritus of Cartagena (Colombia) who has given a life of dedicated service to the Church and was famously kidnapped by Colombian rebels in 2002. Born on March 29, 1942, in Bucaramanga, Colombia, Jiménez began his religious journey by studying philosophy at the Pontifical Javeriana University in Bogotá and theology at the major seminary of the Congregation of Jesus and Mary in Bogotá. On May 17, 1964, at the age of 22, he solemnly professed his vows in the Congregation of Jesus and Mary. He was ordained a priest on June 17, 1967, in Bucaramanga. Jiménez’s early ministry included roles as a professor at the major seminary of Santa Rosa de Osos and as a formator at the Eudist Seminary of Valmaría in Bogotá. He also served as the head of the charitable section of the Eudist Community of El minuto de Dios in Bogotá and as the director of studies at the Theological-Pastoral Institute of CELAM in Medellín.

103,Antoine Kambanda,"Cardinal Antoine Kambanda, the Archbishop of Kigali, is Rwanda’s first cardinal whose personal and profound loss in the country’s 1994 genocide gave him the impetus to work towards his nation’s reconciliation and healing. Born on November 10, 1958, in Rwanda, Kambanda’s early life was marked by tragedy and displacement due to inter-ethnic violence. His family was forced to move to Burundi, Uganda, and Kenya for his education before he returned to Rwanda to pursue his religious vocation. Kambanda attended the junior Seminary in Rutongo, Kigali, and later the Saint Charles Borromeo Major Seminary of Nyakibanda in Butare. In September 1990, he was ordained as a priest by Pope John Paul II who was on a pastoral visit to Rwanda at the time. Following his ordination, Kambanda served as Prefect of Studies at the minor seminary of St. Vincent in Ndera, Kigali. He furthered his education at the Alphonsian Academy in Rome, where he obtained a doctorate in moral theology. During the 1994 Rwandan genocide against the Tutsi, Kambanda suffered further personal tragedy and devastating personal loss when his parents and five of his six siblings, along with many other relatives and friends, were killed. The tragedy deeply influenced his perspective on reconciliation and healing, and Kambanda has emphasized the importance of using the sacrament of penance to help foster forgiveness and resolve ethnic hatred. Kambanda’s career in the Church has been marked by steady progression and increasing responsibilities. He served as the Director of the diocesan office of Caritas in Kigali, head of the “Justice and Peace” Commission, and professor of moral theology. In 2006, he was appointed rector of the Saint Charles Borromeo Major Seminary of Nyakibanda. In September 2005, he was appointed rector of the inter-diocesan major philosophy seminary in Kabgayi. On 10 February 2006 Kambanda was appointed rector of the Saint Charles Borromeo Major Seminary of Nyakibanda. In June 2011 he led five hundred Rwandan pilgrims Namugongo, Uganda, to join the Martyrs Day ceremonies to commemorate the 45 Christian converts who were killed in 1884 by King Mwanga II of Buganda. In his homily, he said that the sacrifice the martyrs made had greatly helped the spread of Christianity in Africa by showing missionaries that converts would be willing to die for their faith In May, 2013, Pope Francis appointed Kambanda as Bishop of Kibungo and then Archbishop of Kigali in November 2018. His most significant elevation came on November 28, 2020, when Pope Francis raised him to the rank of cardinal, making him the first cardinal from Rwanda. Cardinal Kambanda has been appointed to several important positions within the Catholic Church. He is a member of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and the Congregation for Catholic Education. In August 2022, he was appointed as Spiritual Protector and Chaplain General of the Orléans obedience of the Military and Hospitaller Order of Saint Lazarus of Jerusalem. Spurred on by his own personal suffering, Cardinal Kambanda is known for his passionate commitment to peace and reconciliation, which has been a central theme in his ministry. He has addressed the complex role of the Catholic Church during the atrocities; he acknowledged that while some clergy members tried to protect people, others were complicit in the killings. In other areas, Kambanda is firmly opposed to abortion and same sex “marriage.” “There cannot be marriage of man to man, or woman to woman. Marriage is between man and woman,” he has said. Although he has not spoken out about same sex “blessings,” it is likely he aligns with his brother bishops in Africa in rejecting Fiducia Supplicans. In his role as a leader in the Rwandan Catholic Church, Kambanda faces the ongoing challenge of rebuilding trust and fostering healing in a nation still grappling with the aftermath of the genocide. His emphasis on this area means he has spoken little or not at all about hot-button topics of concern primarily to the West.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Kambanda emphasizes reconciliation and healing in the aftermath of the Rwandan genocide, underscoring the sacrament of penance as a means to foster forgiveness.

Three years later, he became the Archbishop of Paraná, a position he held until his retirement on April 29, 2003, at the age of 77. Karlic’s service to the Church was further recognized when he was elevated to the position of Cardinal on November 24, 2007. He was subsequently installed as Cardinal-Priest of Beata Maria Vergine Addolorata a piazza Buenos Aires on February 2, 2008. Throughout his career, Cardinal Karlic has been known for his “theologically moderate” approach, balancing conservative and liberal ideas. He has particularly emphasized the importance of family, describing it as “the sanctuary of love and of life.” He believes that “the human community is destined for fraternity.” From 1986 to 1992, he was a member of the editorial commission of the new Catechism of the Catholic Church, headed by Cardinal Christoph Schönborn.

105,Walter Kasper,"Cardinal Walter Kasper, the president emeritus of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, is a retired German liberal theologian who has played a significant role in the Church’s ecumenical efforts and theological discourse. Born on March 5, 1933, in Heidenheim an der Brenz, Germany, Kasper was ordained priest in 1957. He pursued his academic career, earning a doctorate in dogmatic theology from the University of Tübingen and later becoming a faculty member there. Throughout his career, Kasper has held several notable positions within the Catholic Church. He served as the Bishop of Rottenburg-Stuttgart from 1989 to 1999. In 2001, Pope John Paul II elevated him to the rank of cardinal and appointed him as the President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity, a position he held until 2010. Kasper’s achievements are numerous and significant. He is renowned for his work in Christian ecumenical relations, having served on the World Council of Churches’ Faith and Order Commission and as co-chairman of the Lutheran-Catholic Commission of Unity. He has also been at the forefront of efforts to promote dialogue between Catholics and Jews, earning him the “Memorial Mural Award” from the International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation in 2004. An accomplished progressive theologian, Kasper has authored many books and articles, contributing to Catholic theological discourse. He has been particularly influential in shaping the Church’s approach to pastoral issues, often at times igniting significant controversy due to his liberal ideas. His view of ecumenism, for example, is decidedly post-conciliar and marks a break with traditional Church teaching.1 One of the most notable events in Kasper’s career has been his close association with Pope Francis. Often referred to as “the Pope’s theologian,” Kasper has been instrumental in articulating and defending Francis’s theological vision. He played a crucial role in debates surrounding pastoral practices, particularly in relation to family issues and the reception of communion by divorced and remarried Catholics during the 2014 and 2015 Synods on the Family. His proposal for change in this area was met with considerable opposition from more orthodox elements within the Church. In 2014, Cardinal Kasper caused a furore when he was recorded as saying that when it came to stances on such issues as homosexuality, he believed people in Africa “should not tell us too much what we [in the West] have to do” as for them these issues remain a taboo. He later issued an apology, stating, “If one of my remarks about Africans was perceived as demeaning or insulting, then I am honestly sorry.” More recently, Kasper has been critical of the German Synodal Way, warning that its plans for a “synodal council” where bishops and lay Catholics share decision-making power could violate the Church’s sacramental structure. Kasper was one of several progressive Church leaders who met annually from 1995 to 2006 in St. Gallen, Switzerland, to discuss Church reform and work to prevent Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger being elected pope in 2005.","• Theology/Ideology: Kasper is a progressive theologian known for his liberal views on ecumenism and pastoral issues, often advocating for a break from traditional Church teachings.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is seen as a skilled negotiator and mediator, capable of engaging in sensitive theological discussions while maintaining a collaborative spirit.  
• Power Base: His influence stems from his close relationship with Pope Francis and his leadership role within the ecumenical movement, which has garnered him support among liberal factions in the Church.

106,Tarcisio Isao Kikuchi,"Cardinal Tarcisio Isao Kikuchi, the Archbishop of Tokyo and current president of Caritas Internationalis, has dedicated much of his life to missionary work and humanitarian causes, advocating for the marginalized and promoting “unity in diversity” — his episcopal motto. Born on November 1, 1958, in Iwate, Japan, Kikuchi was the son of a catechist and raised by Swiss missionaries which greatly influenced his spiritual formation and desire to become a missionary. Kikuchi joined the Divine Word Missionaries, took his vows in March 1985 and was ordained priest on March 15, 1986. He pursued additional studies at the Spiritual Institute of Sacred Heart in Melbourne, broadening his theological education. Following his ordination, Kikuchi embarked on his missionary journey to Ghana, where he served from 1986 to 1992 as a parish priest in rural areas. The experience, particularly in the Archdiocese of Accra and the Diocese of Koforidua, profoundly shaped his perspective on happiness and community support. He observed that despite facing numerous challenges, the people he encountered found joy in the knowledge that they would never be forgotten or abandoned in times of difficulty. Upon returning to Japan, Kikuchi took on various leadership positions within his order and the broader Church: provincial councilor of the Divine Word Missionaries (1994-1999); executive director of Caritas Japan (1999-2004); Bishop of Niigata (2004-2017); Archbishop of Tokyo since 2017, and president of Caritas Internationalis since May 2023. Pope Francis elevated him to the cardinalate on December 7, 2024, making Kikuchi the seventh Japanese national to be elevated to the Sacred College. Kikuchi’s dedication to humanitarian causes and Church leadership has been recognized through several appointment. He served as executive director of Caritas Japan from 1999 to 2004, first gaining experience working in then-Zaire, now the DRC. He was head of Caritas Asia from 2011 to 2019. He has also held several other leadership positions including president of the Japanese bishops’ conference, and secretary general of the Federation of Asian Bishops Conferences. The cardinal holds many views that align with the focus of this pontificate. He considers climate change a serious issue affecting people in Asia, particularly those in challenging social situations and poverty. He has emphasized that environmental mismanagement affects everyone regardless of nationality or geography and calls for collective action to address pressing environmental challenges. Kikuchi views migration as one of the biggest problems facing the Church and society today. He notes that in aging societies like Japan and Korea, migrants are necessary to maintain the population, but there is often resistance to integrating them. He sees the integration of migrants, many of whom are Catholics, as a main issue for the Catholic Church to address. The cardinal supports the concept of synodality promoted by Pope Francis. He emphasizes the importance of attentive listening, inclusivity, and creating space for all voices to be heard and valued; he sees synodality as a force for social transformation that fosters a culture of encounter and solidarity transcending borders. In 2023, Kikuchi contributed to a book titled “LGBT and Christianity,” a volume supportive of “LGBT” rights that was edited by Aika Taira, a homosexual pastor of the Protestant United Church of Japan. Kikuchi’s archdiocese also supports an “LGBT” Catholic group, including its monthly Masses. It is not clear where he stands on same-sex blessings. During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, he decided to cancel plans for his parishes to provide services to participants and support staff of the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics in Tokyo, requesting visitors to refrain from visiting churches. This decision, while potentially controversial, was made in response to Japan’s fourth state of emergency due to the pandemic. Mission and evangelization are important for the cardinal; he sees them as vital to “sow and witness the Gospel in our society today.” Kikuchi has been a staunch advocate for dialogue with North Korea, seeing it as the “only solution to peaceful coexistence in this part of Asia.” The cardinal speaks Japanese and English.","• Theology/Ideology: Kikuchi promotes “unity in diversity” and emphasizes social justice, environmental stewardship, and the integration of migrants as central tenets of his faith.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his inclusive approach, valuing attentive listening and fostering dialogue to address complex societal issues.

107,Michael Mitchai Kitbunchu,"Cardinal Michael Michai Kitbunchu is a retired Thai prelate and his country’s first cardinal who has been vocal on various social and moral issues, especially abortion and drug trafficking. As of 2024, he is the longest serving cardinal having received his red hat in 1983. Born on January 25, 1929, in Sam Phran, Nakhon Pathom Province, Thailand, his family is of Chinese descent. He pursued his religious education at the minor seminary of Si Racha before advancing his studies at the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome, where he earned licentiates in philosophy and theology. Ordained to the priesthood on December 20, 1959, by Cardinal Grégoire-Pierre Agagianian in Rome, Kitbunchu returned to Thailand to serve in various pastoral roles. He worked as an assistant pastor and later as a pastor in Bang Kham, followed by a position as pastor of Calvary Parish in Bangkok. His leadership qualities were recognized early, as he also served as an archdiocesan consultor and rector of the metropolitan seminary of Bangkok from 1965 to 1972. Kitbunchu’s episcopal career began on December 18, 1972, when Pope Paul VI appointed him as the second Archbishop of Bangkok. He received his episcopal consecration on June 3, 1973. His influence extended beyond his archdiocese, as he served as President of the Thai Episcopal Conference for two terms, from 1979 to 1982 and again from 2000 to 2006. A significant milestone in Kitbunchu’s career came on February 2, 1983, when Pope John Paul II elevated him to the rank of Cardinal-Priest of San Lorenzo in Panisperna, making him the first Thai cardinal. He participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. Throughout his tenure, Cardinal Kitbunchu has been vocal on various social and moral issues. He has expressed strong opposition to abortion and denied funeral Masses to drug traffickers, citing their destructive impact on society. During Thailand’s 2006 political crisis, he called for national unity and reconciliation. After serving as Archbishop of Bangkok for 36 years, Kitbunchu resigned from his position on May 14, 2009. At the time of his retirement, he held the distinction of being the oldest active head of an archdiocese in the Latin Church.

108,Kurt Koch,"Cardinal Kurt Koch was born into a merchant’s family on March 15, 1950, in Emmenbrücke (diocese of Basel) in the Swiss canton of Lucerne. From a young age, he was interested in ecumenism. He studied theology in Munich, Germany, and in Lucerne, Switzerland. After his studies, he worked as a lay theologian. From 1976 to 1978, he worked on a research project with the Episcopal Commission Iustitia et Pax, together with Professor Franz Furger, on questions relating to human life in contemporary society from the Christian ethical point of view. From 1979 to 1982 he was a university assistant in the field of systematic theology at the Theology Faculty of Lucerne. He was ordained at the age of 32, entering the priesthood in Bern, and developed an interest in dogmatics and moral theology as well as ecumenism and Protestant thought. In 1987, he defended his doctoral dissertation on the work of the German Evangelical theologian Wolfhart Pannenberg.1 He remained affiliated with the University of Lucerne, earning his habilitation in 1989, and there became a professor of dogmatics and liturgy, as well as professor of ecumenical theology at the Educational Institute. In December 1995, he was named bishop of Basel and was personally ordained to the episcopate by Pope John Paul II. As bishop, he did not set aside his academic work, and continued publishing articles and theological works. From 1998 to 2006 he was vice-president of the Swiss Bishops’ Conference, and president from 2007 to 2009. In July 2010, Benedict XVI called him to Rome, appointing him president of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. He succeeded German Bishop Walter Kasper in this position. In the same year he was created a cardinal. From 2010 to the present, the cardinal has not changed functions, but in 2022, under the constitution Praedicate evangelium, the Pontifical Council was transformed into a Dicastery, and the cardinal became prefect. A year earlier, Francis had elevated him to the rank of cardinal-presbyter. Within the Roman Curia, Kurt Koch is a member of several other dicasteries, including the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith. While before 2010 he published on various theological topics, since coming to the Roman Curia he has focused on ecumenical issues. Highlights of his work in Rome include the 2016 ecumenical meeting in Lund preceding the 500th anniversary of the beginning of the Reformation and the publication of a document on papal primacy in synodal perspective in 2024. Cardinal Kurt Koch combines a calm persona with years of curial experience. A somewhat shy man who shuns controversy, he has an in-depth knowledge of the German-speaking Church and is aware of the problems posed by theology in the German-speaking world — a crucial attribute given the challenges to Church unity emanating from German-speaking countries. The Swiss cardinal is known for his strong skepticism of the German Synodal Way, while at the same time he is regarded as a man open to making cautious changes, which he expressed, for example, in a comprehensive study of the papal ministry in 2024. The fact that he conducted such a study also shows that Koch is a master of the subject: he knows the Pope’s role in the Church, how the history of the papacy has been shaped, and where the papacy may or may not be headed in the future. The cardinal is able to scrupulously separate his own theological views from what his office requires of him — something seen as a strength but also a weakness. He has demonstrated this by completely abandoning his prior support for making priestly celibacy optional, or even his earlier advocacy of women’s ordination. Benedict XVI possessed the same quality which some admire, but which others see as a weakness, especially given the importance of such matters. How certain is Koch of his principles, his critics ask, if he is able to so readily reverse them to align with the pope of the day? Koch’s knowledge of a broad range of issues can also be said to be rather blinkered. For many years he has been dealing with essentially only one topic in his work — ecumenism. Certainly, it is an important topic for the present and future of the Church, but it is only one of many other central ecclesial challenges. Furthermore, Koch’s ecumenical thought is deeply rooted in the teaching of the Second Vatican Council and in the development of post-conciliar ecumenism — something which has become increasingly criticized as vague, directionless and diverging from apostolic tradition. Koch, whose responsibility has been to oversee the Church’s relationship with Judaism, has fully embraced the post-conciliar approach to the Jews which states that the Church does not have a mission to the Jews but instead prioritizes dialogue. The cardinal has, however, been willing occasionally to uphold the Church’s perennial magisterium in the context of ecumenism, criticizing, for example, radical ideas on intercommunion coming out of ecumenical circles. Koch underlines the importance of the centrality of the Eucharist but is not a proponent of the traditional liturgy, seeing it as an obstacle to unity. His Teutonic intellectual background is oriented toward negotiation and compromise, making him a somewhat diplomatic and pragmatic figure. As a cardinal in the Roman Curia, he has also displayed a healthy conservatism. It is a combination that might not allow him to solve all the Church’s problems, but if elected pope, could allow him to play an important conciliatory and unifying role after the divisive Francis years. Cardinal Koch speaks several languages including German, Italian, French, and English.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Koch emphasizes ecumenism rooted in post-conciliar teachings while maintaining a cautious approach to changes in Church doctrine.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He possesses a calm and diplomatic demeanor, often shying away from controversy while fostering compromise in discussions.  
• Power Base: Koch's extensive experience within the Roman Curia and deep knowledge of the German-speaking Church provide him with significant influence in ecclesiastical matters.  
• Core Motivation: His primary drive appears to be the pursuit of Church unity, balancing tradition with the need for cautious adaptation in a changing theological landscape.","Cardinal Kurt Koch is renowned for his commitment to ecumenism, emphasizing the importance of post-conciliar teachings while carefully navigating changes in Church doctrine.

109,George Jacob Koovakad,"Cardinal George Jacob Koovakad is a trained Vatican diplomat and Syro Malabar archbishop from Kerala, India, who had organized Pope Francis’ international trips from 2021 until his appointment as prefect of the Dicastery for Interreligious Dialogue in January 2025. Born on August 11, 1973, in Chethipuzha, Changanacherry, Kerala, India, Koovakad comes from a “vibrant community where the faith is passed down through generations as a family treasure.” Attending daily Mass was “encouraged,” he has said, and he “never missed daily evening prayer with my family members.” He credits the faith of his family, especially his grandparents, parents and ordained uncle for helping him to discover his vocation to the priesthood. Koovakad completed his intermediate and bachelor’s degrees in chemistry from SB College, Changanassery, where he also served as the president of the Catholic Students Movement. He then pursued his religious education at St Thomas Minor Seminary, Kurichy, and St Joseph Pontifical Seminary, Aluva, obtaining a licentiate in 2004. Ordained priest on July 24, 2004, by Archbishop Joseph Powathil, Koovakad initially served as an assistant vicar at St Mary’s Church, Parel, Changanacherry. He then moved to Rome to further his studies, earning a doctorate in canon law in 2006 from Opus Dei’s Pontifical University of the Holy Cross. After also completing his formation at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in 2006, Koovakad joined the Vatican’s diplomatic service. His diplomatic career included assignments in various countries beginning with Algeria (2006-2009), then South Korea (2009-2012), Iran (2012-2014), Costa Rica (2014-2018), and Venezuela (2018-2020). In July 2020, Koovakad returned to Rome to work as an official in the Secretariat of State. Since 2021, he has been responsible for organizing Pope Francis’ international travels, including visits to Canada, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, South Sudan, and a lengthy trip to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Timor-Leste, and Singapore in 2024. Koovakad has also received several honors throughout his career: he was appointed Chaplain of His Holiness in 2014, and in 2019 named Prelate of Honor of His Holiness. Pope Francis appointed Koovakad as titular archbishop of Nisibis of the Chaldeans and he was consecrated archbishop on November 24, 2024, at Changanassery Cathedral. The Pope elevated Archbishop Koovakad to cardinal on December 7, 2024, making Koovakad one of the Church’s youngest cardinals at the age of 51. Koovakad says he sees two main challenges for the Church and the world: “First, we must recognize the presence of Jesus in our fellow beings and serve them. Second, we are to acknowledge that God has confided a precious responsibility to each one of us for the stewardship of the physical universe and to take care of our common home.” He aligns with Pope Francis’ positions on safeguarding the environment, fostering human fraternity, and reaching out to the poor and the marginalized. Demonstrating his high regard for Cardinal Koovakad, in September 2023 Pope Francis made a video call to Koovakad’s 95-year-old grandmother to inquire about her health and offer his blessings. Koovakad says that to “spread the fragrance of Christ’s love” (from St. Paul’s letter to the Corinthians) is his priority and his chosen episcopal motto. “Whatever we radiate should flow from Jesus.” Cardinal Koovakad is multilingual, and speaks English, Malayalam, and Italian fluently.","• Theology/Ideology: Koovakad emphasizes stewardship of the environment and social justice, aligning closely with Pope Francis' vision for the Church's role in addressing contemporary issues.

110,Francis Xavier Kriengsak Kovithavanij,"Cardinal Francis Xavier Kriengsak Kovithavanij is a former Archbishop of Bangkok whose focus has been primarily on education, peace and reconciliation. Born on June 27, 1949, in Ban Rak, within the archdiocese of Bangkok, his journey in the Church began with his studies at the seminary of St. Joseph in Sampran, followed by further education in theology and philosophy at the Pontifical Urbanian University in Rome from 1970 to 1976. After his ordination as a priest on July 11, 1976, Kovithavanij served in various roles within the Bangkok archdiocese. He began as a parish vicar at the Nativity of Mary Church in Ban Pan and later at the Epiphany Church in Koh Vai. His commitment to education led him to become the vice-rector of the St. Joseph minor seminary in Sampran from 1979 to 1981. Furthering his own studies (1982-1983), he specialized in spirituality at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. Upon returning to Thailand, Kovithavanij took on significant leadership positions. He served as the rector of the Holy Family intermediate seminary in Nakhon Ratchasima for six years and later as the rector of the Lux Mundi national major seminary from 1992 to 2000. His administrative skills were recognized when he was appointed as the under-secretary of the Episcopal Conference from 1989 to 1993. Pope Bendict XVI launched his episcopal career when he appointed Kovithavanij Bishop of Nakhon Sawan in 2007. His leadership qualities led Benedict appointing him Metropolitan Archbishop of Bangkok in 2009, a position he held until his resignation was accepted by Pope Francis on June 27, 2024. Pope Francis elevated Kovithavanij to the rank of Cardinal on February 14, 2015. The cardinal has been an active member of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Thailand, serving as its vice-president since 2009 and later as its President from 2015. Cardinal Kovithavanij has expressed clear views on interreligious dialogue and unity. He believes that Asian Catholics, and Asians in general, have a cultural sensibility that promotes strong values and respects people’s dignity. He stated, “Asian people by nature are religious people. We are open to other religions, to other people. We see the possibilities of interreligious collaboration. We respect each other’s faith.” The cardinal has also shown a strong interest in promoting peace and unity in Thailand, particularly in the context of political instability. He suggested that when the Thai national anthem is broadcast daily, citizens should pause for an additional minute to pray for peace and unity. This proposal was shared with Buddhist and Muslim leaders and later presented to government officials. Due to his focus on issues closer to home, Cardinal Kovithavanij has expressed few, if any, public views on such issues as abortion, climate change, and same-sex blessings.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Kovithavanij emphasizes education, peace, and interreligious dialogue, reflecting a commitment to cultural sensitivity and respect for diverse beliefs.

111,Konrad Krajewski,"A discreet and loyal almoner of the Pope, Cardinal Konrad Krajewski has rapidly risen up through the ranks of the Church, from serving as a mere liturgical official at the last conclave to distributing material assistance on behalf of the Supreme Pontiff to the poor and victims of war. Born November 25, 1963 in Łódź, in 1982, Krajewski enrolled at the Major Seminary in Łódź, after which he attended the Catholic University of Lublin where he received a master’s degree in theology. He was ordained priest in 1988. For two years he carried out pastoral work in his diocese as parish vicar, first in Rusiec and then in Łódź. In 1990 he was sent to Rome to continue his studies at the Liturgical Institute of St Anselmo. In 1993 he obtained a licentiate in sacred liturgy from the same Liturgical Institute and in 1995 a doctorate in theology,with specialization in liturgy, from the Pontifical University of St Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum, with a dissertation on “Episcopal Ordination in the Reform of Vatican II.” During his stay in Rome, he collaborated with the Office of Liturgical Celebrations of the Supreme Pontiff and served as chaplain at the “La Sapienza” University Orthopaedic and Traumatological Clinic. He returned to his diocese in 1995, and became master of ceremonies for Archbishop Władysław Ziolko. He also taught liturgy at the diocesan seminary and in the Franciscan and Salesian Seminary, as well as the Warsaw Academy. In 1997, he served as ceremonialist during Pope St. John Paul II’s visit to Poland. A year later, he moved to Rome to join the Office of Pontifical Liturgical Celebrations, becoming a papal ceremonialist in 1999. Among the ceremonies he served at was the 2013 conclave in the Sistine Chapel. That same year, Pope Francis appointed him papal almoner and consecrated him an archbishop (of Beneventum). In 2018, the Pope elevated him to the College of Cardinals, appointing him cardinal deacon. In 2022, he was named prefect of the newly created Dicastery for the Ministry of Mercy. Cardinal Konrad Krajewski’s work on behalf of the needy, and his commitment to humanitarian work, has earned him the nickname “the Pope’s Robin Hood.” Krajewski is highly discreet and has spoken remarkably little in public apart from homilies. If he does speak at all, his focus is almost exclusively on the role entrusted to him by Pope Francis to set an example on how to carry out acts of mercy. In a rare exception, he expressed criticism of an “equality” event (LGBTQ+ Pride March) in Poland in 2019, but was at pains to point out that Jesus died for all who were taking part, and that they should be invited into the cathedral. His discretion and focus on his assigned task have meant few know what he thinks about topical contentious Church debates, such as ordaining female deacons, priestly celibacy, blessing homosexual couples, restricting the Traditional Latin Mass, the Vatican-China Secret Accords, synodality, Communion for divorced and civilly remarried Catholics, and the German “Synodal Way.” The character of Krajewski is best known through his acts of mercy. These have included keeping churches open during the Covid-19 lockdown, visiting civilians caught in war, running a successful Eucharistic Adoration program in St Peter’s Square, and helping the homeless in Rome — even to the extent of breaking the law. In 2017, he spent a few weeks sleeping in his office so a Syrian refugee family could use his Vatican apartment. Pope Francis has valued his work and loyalty, elevating him to bishop and cardinal, and creating a Vatican dicastery for the papal almoner instead of merely a Vatican office. Cardinal Krajewski speaks Polish and Italian.","• Theology/Ideology: Krajewski embodies a theology of mercy and social justice, emphasizing care for the marginalized and vulnerable as central to his faith.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his discretion and loyalty, often choosing to remain silent on contentious issues while focusing on his humanitarian mission.

112,Jean-Pierre Kutwa,"Cardinal Jean-Pierre Kutwa, the Archbishop of Abidjan, is a music composer who has been a strong advocate for peace and reconciliation as well as ecumenical and interreligious dialogue in his war-torn country. He is Ivory Coast’s third ever cardinal. Born on December 22, 1945 in Blockhauss, Ivory Coast, after attending the minor seminary in Bingerville, Kutwa went on to study theology at Anyama. He was ordained a priest for the archdiocese of Abidjan on July 11, 1971. From 1971-1974 he served as vicar in the Cathedral Parish of Saint Paul du Plateau and as chaplain of the Catholic student youth group.  In 1977 he was appointed as national director of catholic works, and the following year returned to the Cathedral where he served as parish priest from 1978-1985. In the meantime, in 1982 he obtained a “Maîtrise” in biblical theology at the Catholic Institute of West Africa (I.C.A.O) and a doctorate in biblical theology from the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome in 1985. In 1987 he returned to the Ivory Coast where he served as a parish priest of the St. Paul du Plateau Cathedral, as professor of Sacred Scripture at the Anyama seminary, and as diocesan chaplain of the Catholic Student Youth (J.E.C). In 1995 he was assigned as parish priest of Notre Dame du Perpétual Secours in Treichville. On July 7, 1997 he was involved in a serious car accident and almost lost his life. In February 1998 he returned to his parish. Three years later, in September 2001, Pope John Paul II appointed Kutwa metropolitan Archbishop of Gagnoa (Ivory Coast). After representing the Ivory Coast as a delegate at the Synod of Bishops on the Eucharist in 2005, the following year Benedict XVI chose him to be Archbishop of Abidjan, the country’s capital. He took over leadership during a tumultuous time when the country was suffering from the devastation of a decade-long civil war. In 2011, the archbishop went into hiding when a civil war erupted following President Laurent Gbagbo’s refusal to accept defeat in the November 2010 elections. More than 3,000 Ivorians were killed and 500,000 displaced as militias loyal to rival candidate Alassane Ouattara launched a rebellion and seized the country with backing from the United Nations and France, the former colonial power. In 2014, Pope Francis elevated Kutwa to cardinal. As archbishop, Kutwa has been a strong advocate for peace, reconciliation and interreligious dialogue in Ivory Coast. He has spoken out against political corruption and urged Catholics to work for justice, human rights and support for the poor and oppressed. He has spoken little or not at all on issues such as abortion, same-sex blessings, synodality or migration. In addition to his religious duties, Kutwa is also noted as a music composer. In 2024, Cardinal Kutwa became embroiled in a significant controversy when he reinstated a lay charismatic leader named Do Oulaï Franklin Delaneaux (known as Abraham Marie Pio) who had been accused of sexual abuse, financial extortion and psychological manipulation.1In 2020, Kutwa suspended Delaneaux from his Royal Priesthood apostolate over allegations of sexual abuse against women, financial extortion and psychological manipulation. He then set up an ad hoc committee to examine the case. However, on February 9, 2024, the cardinal issued a decree lifting his suspension, allowing him to resume his activities. Cardinal Kutwa stated that Delaneaux had “acknowledged and regretted the facts attributed to him,” though he did not elaborate on the specific details. Critics of the reinstatement said Delaneaux had only partially admitted his guilt, no civil legal action had been taken against him despite the serious nature of the allegations, and lax reinstatement conditions were placed on him.2 Pope Francis accepted Cardinal Kutwa’s resignation as Archbishop of Abijan on May 20, 2024, on age grounds. Cardinal Kutwa speaks French and it is likely he also speaks local Ivorian languages.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Kutwa emphasizes peace, reconciliation, and interreligious dialogue, while largely avoiding contentious social issues.

113,Gérald Cyprien Lacroix,"Cardinal Gérald Cyprien Lacroix, the Archbishop of Quebec and Primate of Canada, is a trusted member of Pope Francis’ Council of Cardinal advisers known for his dedication to evangelization. He was recently cleared of allegations of sexual abuse. Born on July 27, 1957, in Saint-Hilaire de Dorset in the archdiocese of Quebec, Lacroix has had a distinguished career in the Catholic Church. In 1982, he professed his perpetual vows in the Institut Séculier Pie X, and Lacroix’s commitment to missionary work was evident early in his career when he traveled to Colombia as a missionary in 1981. He completed a bachelor’s in theology and a master’s degree at the University of Laval. He was immediately appointed general secretary of the Institut Séculier Pie X, an office he held until 1987. At the same time, he also served as director of the Centre for Christian Formation and Renewal in Quebec. Ordained as a priest on October 8, 1988, Lacroix served in various capacities within the Church. He returned to work as a missionary in Colombia from 1990 to 1998, where he was a pastor in a parish and a professor at the major seminary of San José and held several important positions in the archdiocese of Popayán, including director of the commission on the liturgy and communications and consecrated life. In 2001, he was elected as director general of the Pius X Secular Institute where he served for two consecutive terms. He also served as president of the secretariat of the Saint-André School of Evangelization in Canada and as a member of the executive council of the Worldwide Conference of Secular Institutes. In 2009, he was consecrated bishop and appointed titular Bishop of Ilta and auxiliary of Quebec. His ascent in the Church hierarchy continued when Benedict XVI appointed him Archbishop of Quebec on February 22, 2011, succedent to Cardinal Marc Ouellet who had been appointed prefect of the Congregation for Bishops. Pope Francis elevated Lacroix to the College of Cardinals on February 22, 2014. Since then, Lacroix has been appointed to several significant positions within the Church, including being a member of the Council of Cardinals, member of the Council for the Economy, member of the Ordinary Council for the Synod of Bishops, and a member of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, the Dicastery for Laity, Family and Live, the Dicastery of Culture and Education and the Dicastery for Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life. Lacroix participated in the 2015 Synod on the Family and was selected to be on the Ordinary Council of the Synod on Synodality. He said he considered the Synod to be “an extraordinary place of listening and meeting.” He also underlined what he saw as the importance of this approach by declaring that the Synod as not a parliamentary place, but rather a space where “we are brothers and sisters who seek together what the Spirit says to our Church today.” He has also been recognized for his work, receiving an honorary doctorate in divinity from Saint Anselm College in 2011 and one from Saint Paul University in Ottawa. In January 2024, Lacroix was named in a class action lawsuit against the Archdiocese of Quebec, alleging he had inappropriately touched a 17-year-old female in 1987 and 1988. Lacroix categorically denied the allegations. Following a Vatican-commissioned investigation by André Denis, a retired Judge of the Superior Court of Quebec, the Holy See Press Office dismissed the anonymous complaint in May 2024. Lacroix resumed his duties on July 22, 2024, after a voluntary six-month withdrawal. The cardinal drew headlines in 2021 by controversially closing all churches in Quebec and suspending collective celebrations over Christmas due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The suspension of liturgical celebrations was comprehensive, affecting both Christmas and New Year’s celebrations. However, funerals were still permitted to take place. During Cardinal Lacroix’s tenure, vocations have significantly fallen in Quebec which has suffered from profound secularization. In 2010, the total number of priests in the archdiocese was 701 but by 2022 the number had almost halved to 410. Male religious numbers over halved from 629 in 2010 to 310 in 2022, and the number of female religious declined from 2,729 to 1,498 over the same period Cardinal Lacroix speaks French, English and Spanish.","• Theology/Ideology: Lacroix emphasizes evangelization and a pastoral approach to Church matters, promoting dialogue and inclusivity as seen in his participation in the Synod on Synodality.

115,Luis Francisco Ladaria Ferrer,"Cardinal Luis Francisco Ladaria Ferrer is a retired Spanish Jesuit and respected orthodox-leaning theologian who served as prefect of the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith from 2017 to 2023. Born on April 19, 1944, in Manacor, Spain, Ladaria completed his law degree from the University of Madrid in 1966 before joining the Society of Jesus. He pursued further studies in philosophy and theology at prestigious institutions, including the Comillas Pontifical University and the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he obtained his doctorate in theology in 1975. His academic career began as a professor of dogmatic theology at the Comillas Pontifical University in Madrid. In 1984, he moved to the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he also served as vice-rector from 1986 to 1994. Ladaria’s expertise in theology led to his appointment as a member of the International Theological Commission in 1992 and as a consultor of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 1995. In 2004, Ladaria was named Secretary-General of the International Theological Commission. He played a significant role in evaluating the concept of limbo and the salvation prospects for unbaptized infants. His career in the Vatican Curia advanced further when Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as Secretary of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in 2008, elevating him to the rank of archbishop. The pinnacle of Ladaria’s career came on July 1, 2017, when Pope Francis appointed him prefect of the Congregation (now Dicastery) for the Doctrine of the Faith. This position also made him president of several pontifical commissions. In recognition of his service, Pope Francis created him a cardinal on June 28, 2018. Cardinal Ladaria, as the prefect of the DDF, made several important doctrinal statements. He strongly reaffirmed traditional Catholic teaching on human sexuality and anthropology, stating that the “truth about the human person and sexuality does not change even as prevailing ideology exalts ‘freedom without relation to truth’”. He emphasized that the Church’s teachings on sexuality, love, and life remain relevant today, despite changing cultural attitudes. Specifically, Ladaria defended the teachings of Pope Paul VI’s encyclical Humanae Vitae, saying it “bases its doctrine on the truth of the act of conjugal love, the inseparable connection that God has willed and that man cannot break on his own initiative, between the two meanings of the conjugal act.”1 Cardinal Ladaria forcefully reiterated the Church’s teaching on restricting priestly ordination to men. He stated that maleness is “an indispensable element” of the priesthood and that the Church is “bound” by Christ’s decision to only choose male apostles. He further declared this teaching to be infallible and “definitive,” arguing it should be held as an unchanging part of Catholic faith. Ladaria issued a strong critique of Germany’s Synodal Path process, saying among other things that it lacked confidence in the Magisterium’s vision, reduced the Magisterium to a single statement, and overlooked the role of bishops as successors to the apostles. While not making a definitive statement, Ladaria cautioned the US bishops about formulating a national policy on denying Communion to pro-abortion politicians. He emphasized that individual bishops have authority within their own dioceses on the matter. Cardinal Ladaria consistently emphasized the importance of safeguarding Catholic doctrine. He stated, “Our mission is to promote and protect the doctrine of the faith. A task that will always be necessary in the Church, which has the duty to transmit the teaching of the Apostles to new generations.” In 2021 and as head of the then-CDF, the Spanish Jesuit theologian issued a Responsum that maintained a clear stance against blessing same-sex unions while allowing for blessings of individuals, regardless of sexual orientation, who seek to live according to Church teaching. The ruling was not well received by some in the LGBT community, leading to Ladaria’s successor, Cardinal Victor Fernández, to publish Fiducia Supplicans, a document that critics said substantially weakened and even contradicted the Responsum. As an expert theologian, Cardinal Ladaria was chosen by Pope Francis to be a Synod Father at the 2023 Synod on Synodality assembly but the cardinal asked to be removed from the list, possibly pointing to some differences with the synodal process. He also did not take part in the second and final session in October 2024. Ladaria maintained a consistent record of upholding traditional Church teaching on marriage and sexual morality. His statements reflected a commitment to preserving Catholic doctrine in the face of changing cultural attitudes and internal Church debates. At the same time, he emphasized a shift away from the Vatican’s doctrinal office’s historical reputation as an inquisitorial body. “We are no longer the Inquisition,” he said. “The index no longer exists.” As prefect and in his prior role as CDF secretary, Ladaria was involved in overseeing the Dicastery’s work on sexual abuse cases which comprised a significant portion of his office’s workload. In 2018, he was named as a co-defendant in a private prosecution in France related to Cardinal Philippe Barbarin’s handling of a sexual abuse case. The Vatican invoked diplomatic immunity on Ladaria’s behalf in this matter.2 Cardinal Barbarin was later exonerated of mishandling the case. A humble and discreet Jesuit who gave very few interviews, Cardinal Ladaria was a respected professor of theology at the Gregorian. He was also lauded for leading the DDF through a challenging period when orthodoxy was facing opposition and resistance from some of the highest levels of the Church. Cardinal Ladaria speaks Spanish, Italian, and English.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Ladaria is a staunch defender of traditional Catholic teachings on sexuality, priesthood, and marriage, emphasizing the unchanging nature of these doctrines amidst cultural shifts.

118,Chibly Langlois,"Cardinal Chibly Langlois, the first and only Haitian cardinal in the country’s history, is the current president of Haiti’s Bishops’ Conference who has focused on helping the young and the poor in his country, especially after a series of natural disasters. Born on November 29, 1958, in La Vallée, Haiti, Langlois came from a poor family, which greatly influenced his future work and perspective. He pursued his religious education at the Grand Séminaire Notre-Dame of Port-au-Prince, studying philosophy and theology. Later, he obtained a licentiate in pastoral theology from the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome. Langlois was ordained as a priest on September 22, 1991, for the diocese of Jacmel. His career in the Church progressed rapidly, and on April 8, 2004, he was appointed Bishop of Fort-Liberté by Pope John Paul II. Later, on August 15, 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as Bishop of Les Cayes. A significant milestone in Langlois’ career came in February, 2014, when Pope Francis elevated him to the College of Cardinals. His appointment was historic, as Langlois became the first and only Haitian cardinal in history. Notably, he was also the only new cardinal elevated in that consistory who was not an archbishop. Cardinal Langlois has been known for his tireless work, particularly in the aftermath of the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake when he became a leader in the rebuilding efforts and in providing spiritual support. He has been an advocate for the people, especially focusing on creating opportunities for youth and emphasizing the importance of education. His efforts in providing schooling for impoverished children have been particularly noteworthy. In terms of leadership roles, Langlois has served as the president of Haiti’s Bishops’ Conference since December 2011. He has also been appointed to several Vatican bodies, including the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, the Pontifical Commission for Latin America, and the Secretariat for Communications. Cardinal Langlois has faced some challenges and controversies during his tenure. In 2021, he was injured during the Haiti earthquake when the bishop’s residence partially collapsed, killing a priest and two employees. In 2022, he was involved in a serious car accident, leaving him with several fractures. In 2014, the cardinal criticized voodoo as being a “big social problem” in Haiti, arguing that the religion offers “magic” but no real solutions to a population deprived of justice and a political voice. He linked Haiti’s belief system to its chronic political problems, which he said forced poor Haitians – the overwhelming majority of a population of ten million – to seek solutions in voodoo. His comments were critically received by some in the country. Given Cardinal Langlois’s focus on the social and humanitarian challenges facing Haiti, such as poverty, violence and the consequences of natural disasters, there is no available record of him commenting on other issues.

Al suo ritorno in Canada, si è unito al team di formazione del Grand Séminaire de Montréal, insegnando teologia e filosofia.

120,Augusto Paolo Lojudice,"Cardinal Augusto Paolo Lojudice, the Bishop of Montepulciano-Chiusi-Pienza in central Italy, is a former spiritual director of Rome’s Major Seminary who has focused on helping immigrants and marginalized communities, earning him the nickname “the street priest.” Born on July 1, 1964, in Rome, Lojudice prepared for the priesthood at the Pontifical Major Seminary in Rome and studied philosophy and theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University from 1983 to 1989, obtaining a license in theology with a specialization in fundamental theology. After he was ordained priest in 1989, he began his ministry in some of Rome’s most challenging neighborhoods, earning him the moniker “street priest” due to his dedication to working with immigrants, Roma communities, the poor, and those affected by organized crime. Lojudice’s ecclesiastical life has been marked by several notable appointments and achievements. He served as the spiritual director of Rome’s major seminary and was named an auxiliary bishop of Rome in 2015. In this role, he was responsible for the southern peripheries of the diocese and the seaport city of Ostia as vicar general. His work in these areas earned him recognition from Pope Francis, who reportedly referred to him as the “toughest bishop in the capital.” In 2019, Pope Francis appointed Lojudice as Archbishop of Siena-Colle di Val d’Elsa-Montalcino, a position he currently holds. His dedication to serving the marginalized continued in this role, and he gained further recognition for his efforts. On November 28, 2020, Pope Francis elevated Lojudice to the rank of cardinal, a move that surprised many due to the relatively short time he had been serving as archbishop and the fact that Siena is not typically associated with cardinals. In July 2022, Lojudice was also named Bishop of Montepulciano-Chiusi-Pienza, further expanding his responsibilities within the Church. Throughout his ecclesiastical life, Lojudice has emphasized the importance of interpreting reality and finding solutions together with the people he serves, rather than imposing top-down solutions — an approach similar to synodality. Despite his numerous achievements and accolades, Lojudice is said to remain humble and focused on his mission. He has stated that labels such as “street priest” or “bishop of the Roma” are unnecessary, emphasizing that his work is simply about being a priest and following the Gospel. He views his elevation to the cardinalate not as a reward, but as a call to continue “getting his hands dirty” in the service of the Church and her people. His approach and the issues he chooses to focus on closely resemble those of Pope Francis. Cardinal Lojudice has been actively involved in working with immigrants and marginalized communities throughout his career. He serves as the secretary of the Commission on Migration within the Italian Episcopal Conference. Lojudice has spoken out against anti-immigrant sentiment, stating that “most Romans have a fundamentally charitable attitude and are not easily influenced” by anti-immigrant rhetoric. Cardinal Lojudice is not on record as speaking out on other pressing issues such as abortion, secularisation, or the liturgy.","• Theology/Ideology: Lojudice emphasizes a synodal approach to ministry, focusing on collaboration and understanding rather than imposing authority.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his humility and dedication, often described as ""the street priest"" due to his commitment to serving marginalized communities.

Ha servito più volte come Presidente della Conferenza Episcopale Dominicana e ha ricoperto ruoli significativi nel Consiglio Episcopale Latino Americano (CELAM), compresa la sua presidenza dal 1991 al 1995. I suoi contributi alla Chiesa e alla società sono stati riconosciuti con vari premi, tra cui la Gran Croce di Isabella la Cattolica da parte del Re Juan Carlos I di Spagna. Il 28 giugno 1991, Papa Giovanni Paolo II ha elevato López Rodríguez al rango di cardinale, assegnandogli la chiesa titolare di San Pio X alla Balduina. Come cardinale, ha partecipato ai conclavi che hanno eletto i Papi Benedetto XVI e Francesco.

122,Cristóbal López Romero,"Cardinal Cristóbal López Romero is a Spanish-born Salesian prelate currently serving as the Archbishop of Rabat, Morocco, where he has dedicated himself to dialogue with Muslims and the well-being of migrants. A fervent supporter of the Synod on Synodality, he has said he believes the synodal process goes further than democratizing the Church, and that anyone who disagrees with its decisions is “morally obligated” to support them. Born on May 19, 1952, in Vélez-Rubio, Spain, López Romero joined the Salesian order at a young age, taking his first vows at 16 and his solemn vows at 22. After completing his philosophical and theological studies at the Salesian seminaries of Girona and Barcelona, López Romero was ordained priest on May 19, 1979. His early ministry focused on serving marginalized communities in Barcelona. In 1984, he embarked on a journey that would shape his career, leaving for Paraguay where he engaged in youth pastoral care and held various leadership positions within the Salesians. López Romero’s international experience is extensive. He spent nearly two decades in Paraguay (1984 to 2003), then moved to Morocco where he directed a professional formation center in Kénitra from 2003 to 2011. He returned to Latin America as the Salesian provincial superior in Bolivia from 2011 to 2014, before heading back to Spain to lead the Salesian province of María Auxiliadora from 2014 to 2017. During these assignments he also served as director of pastoral and scholastic ministry. In 2017, Pope Francis appointed López Romero as Archbishop of Rabat, and two years later elevated him to cardinal. Cardinal López Romero has been a strong advocate for interreligious dialogue, particularly between Christians and Muslims, given his leadership position in Morocco, a Muslim-majority country. He has praised Pope Francis for prioritizing this dialogue, despite criticism from some quarters of the Church. He noted in 2022 that Francis has deliberately created cardinals who promote interreligious dialogue. A significant event in his career was hosting Pope Francis during his visit to Morocco in March 2019, which marked the eighth centenary of the historic encounter between Saint Francis of Assisi and Sultan al-Malik al-Kamil. After the visit, Cardinal López Romero took several steps to build upon its momentum including launching a diocesan synod to encourage the Catholic community in Morocco to more fully live out its mission of “encounter and dialogue.” López Romero considers migration not to be a “problem” but “to be the consequence of many problems,” and sees its root causes being poverty, wars, famines, climate change, and economic inequality, which he says all need to be addressed. The cardinal has proposed dedicating a synod specifically to migration, which he sees as a worldwide phenomenon requiring reflection by the entire Catholic Church. He has expressed concern about the lack of compassion shown by some Christians towards migrants and other vulnerable groups, and stated that he suffers when people, after attending Mass, ask him not to “send migrants from Morocco anymore.” Cardinal López Romero has been a strong supporter of synodality and took part in the Synod on Synodality.1 In November 2024, days after it had ended, he made headlines by saying that those who disagree with its decisions are “morally obligated” to support them. He also said he believed synodality was a “prophetic sign” that could “enlighten the world because it is not just about bringing democracy to the Church, as many have stated, but it goes much further.”2 The cardinal launched his own diocesan synod in the archdiocese of Rabat, indicating his alignment with the Church’s current emphasis on synodal processes. Given his preoccupation with interreligious and migration matters in Rabat, he does not appear to have spoken out on many other issues. Cardinal López Romero speaks Spanish, his native language, French, and potentially some Arabic, though this is not confirmed.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal López Romero is a proponent of synodality, viewing it as a transformative process that extends beyond democratization to include moral obligations toward collective decisions.

123,Thomas Aquino Manyo Maeda,"Cardinal Thomas Aquino Manyo Maeda is a Japanese prelate known for his service to people with disabilities, his work in communications, education, ecumenism, and his involvement in a peace movement in Hiroshima. Born on March 3, 1949, in Tsuwasaki, Kami-Goto, Nagasaki Prefecture, Japan, he completed his studies at the Nanzan Lyceum in Nagasaki and entered the Saint Sulpitius Major Seminary in Fukuoka. Maeda was ordained as a priest on March 19, 1975, and incardinated in the diocese of Nagasaki. Throughout his career, Maeda has held various positions within the Catholic Church. He served as a parish vicar, parish priest, editor of the diocesan Bulletin, and head of the diocesan Commission for Social Communications. From 2006 to 2011, he was the secretary general of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Japan. On June 13, 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Maeda as the Bishop of Hiroshima, and he received episcopal consecration in September 2011. As a native of Nagasaki and as Bishop of Hiroshima, Cardinal Maeda was widely involved in the peace movement in Hiroshima, where he served as bishop for three years. He also worked for the beatification of “hidden Christians” who had been exiled to Tsuwano, part of Hiroshima Diocese. In the final outbreak of anti-Christian persecution in Japan 150 years ago, some 3,400 Christians from Nagasaki were exiled to various places throughout the country, and more than 600 died. Pope Francis appointed Maeda the Archbishop of Osaka in 2014. He served as the vice president of the Japanese Catholic Bishops’ Conference from 2016 to 2022. In June 2018, Pope Francis elevated Maeda to the rank of cardinal. Most recently, on August 15, 2023, Pope Francis erected the new metropolitan archdiocese of Osaka-Takamatsu and appointed Cardinal Maeda its first metropolitan archbishop. The cardinal is known for his involvement with people with disabilities and has served on the bishops’ conference committees for education and ecumenism. Cardinal Maeda has weighed in on some issues important to this pontificate, and the Church in general. He views synodality as a way to keep the Catholic faith alive in Japan. He stated, “Synodality can be used to keep a significant presence. The communion, the service, the mission are ways to stay present in society.” He sees it as a means to maintain the Church’s relevance in Japanese society. The cardinal appears to have a positive view on migration in relation to the Catholic Church in Japan. He has suggested that God’s plan might include “the influx of migrants to save the Catholic Church here.” Cardinal Maeda is known for his strong anti-nuclear stance. This position is influenced by his personal history, as his mother died of leukemia due to radiation poisoning from the atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki. The cardinal has acknowledged the difficulty in keeping Catholicism relevant in modern Japan, where its population is falling and ageing. He has noted a gap between Church teaching on issues like contraception and abortion and the reality in Japanese society. “The difficulty is most Japanese people believe the Catholic Church is very strict and that’s a problem,” he told The Catholic Herald in October 2024. However, he sees it as a state problem rather than a moral one. “The ageing population and fewer children being born is certainly the biggest issue for us,” Cardinal Maeda said. “But I believe the slowing birth rate is a problem for the government of Japan to solve, not the Church.” Cardinal Maeda, who can trace his Catholic heritage back to when the Gospel arrived on Japanese shores in the sixteenth century, nevertheless remains optimistic. “The first Japanese Christians refused to renounce their faith despite being tortured and murdered, and they will be strong again,” he said. The cardinal does not appear to have spoken out on such issues the traditional Latin Mass, priestly celibacy or same-sex blessings. The cardinal is a master of haiku, a short Japanese poetic form, and often incorporates his poems into his sermons and articles. Haiku has Buddhist roots and offers a Zen snapshot of the universe. Cardinal Maeda speaks Japanese and English.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Maeda advocates for synodality as a means to maintain the Catholic Church's relevance in Japan amidst declining membership.

124,Soane Patita Paini Mafi,"Cardinal Soane Patita Paini Mafi, the first cardinal in Tonga’s history, has been a vocal campaigner against climate change and the negative impact of globalization on his country’s traditional culture. Born on December 19, 1961, in Nuku’alofa, Tonga, he comes from a devout Catholic family, with both his father and grandfather serving as catechists. Raised in a fale (thatched) house, Mafi’s early life was rooted in traditional Tongan culture. Mafi pursued his religious education at the Pacific Regional Seminary in Suva, Fiji, where he earned a degree in divinity. He was ordained as a priest on June 29, 1991, at the age of 29. Following his ordination, he spent four years in parish work on the Tongan island of Ha’apai. In 1995, at the young age of 34, Mafi was appointed vicar general of the diocese, just five years after his ordination. He furthered his education in the United States, studying religious education at Loyola University in Baltimore, Maryland, and graduating in 2000. He also earned a degree in pastoral counseling from Ignatius Loyola College in Maryland in 1998. Mafi’s ascent through the Church hierarchy was swift. He was appointed coadjutor bishop of Tonga in June 2007 and consecrated as bishop that same year. In April, 2008, he succeeded Bishop Soane Lilo Foliaki as the Bishop of Tonga, becoming the first diocesan priest to hold this position. Tonga has a small Catholic population estimated in 2021 to be 12,000 to 15,000 faithful, approximately 12-15% of the country’s population. In February, 2015, Pope Francis appointed Mafi as a cardinal, making him the first ever cardinal from Tonga. At the time of his appointment, he was the youngest member of the College of Cardinals at 53 years old. Mafi has held several significant positions within the Church. He has been the president of the Episcopal Conference of the Pacific since 2010. The bishops’ conference covers a large area comprising 14 Dioceses, 1 Prefecture Apostolic and 1 Missio Sui Iuris. He also participated in both the 2014 and 2015 Synods on the Family. As a cardinal from the South Pacific, Mafi has been vocal about the challenges facing his region. He has expressed concern about the impact of climate change on the low-lying areas in the Pacific. He has endorsed the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, stating that there was a need for a larger “collective voice on behalf of [our] Mother Earth and its vulnerable people.” This, he said, “is undoubtedly very urgent now.” Mafi has also highlighted the negative effects of globalization on traditional social structures and communal living in Tonga. He worries about the tendency towards materialism and individualism that can result from these global influences. In his role as a Church leader, Mafi has emphasized the need for deepening faith among his community, as reflected in his Episcopal motto, “Deepen the Faith.” He has also stressed the importance of the Church offering hope and mercy to the world. Cardinal Mafi has emphasized the importance of the Church being humble yet filled with the “fire of the Spirit.” He hopes for a Church that is passionate about sharing the “good news” and restoring hope in the world. He believes the Church should offer a message of “Hope and Mercy of God” to today’s world. In 2018, Cardinal Mafi caused controversy by expressing sympathy for a famous Tongan transgender activist, Joey Jolene Mataele, who campaigns for the “rights of transgender women” and is the co-founder of the Pacific Sexual Diversity Network and founder of the “Miss Galaxy Queen Pageant.” Mateale, whose initiatives have been supported by Tongan royal family’s Princess Salote Lupepau’u Tuita,1 is also the Pacific Island Representative on the International Gay and Lesbian Association (ILGA) Executive Board and Chairperson of the South Pacific MSM (Men Who Have Sex with Men) Network Group. Mateale attended the 2015 consistory at which Cardinal Mafi was created a cardinal. A 2018 documentary film called “Leitis in Waiting – LGBT+ and Cultural Diversity,” featured Cardinal Mafi’s 2016 address at “Tongo Laeti’s National Consultation ‘Together for Positive Change’” Conference. He is quoted as saying: “In Tonga, we are still finding our way in this modern world, with lots of challenges as well as things to learn. We must stand strong against discrimination and violence, abuse – all kinds of abuse. The good thing about Joey and co. is that they have the courage by persecution, perhaps people saying things against them. I hope there will be a time when people become more loving and tender-hearted.” Cardinal Mafi does not appear to have weighed in on such issues as abortion or same-sex blessings, but under his leadership, the Catholic Church in Tonga opposed the ratification of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), citing concerns about its potential impact on traditional beliefs, including issues like abortion and same-sex “marriage.” Cardinal Mafi speaks Tongan, his native language, and English.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Mafi advocates for a Church that emphasizes hope, mercy, and the need to address climate change and globalization's effects on traditional cultures.

125,Roger Michael Mahony,"Il Cardinale Roger Michael Mahony, Arcivescovo emerito di Los Angeles, è un prelato progressista in pensione, dedito a progetti di giustizia sociale, ma che ha anche affrontato severe critiche per la sua gestione dei casi di abusi sessuali all’interno dell’arcidiocesi metropolitana. Nato il 27 febbraio 1936 a Hollywood, California, Mahoney è stato il primo nativo di Angeleno a servire come Arcivescovo di Los Angeles. È cresciuto nella San Fernando Valley e ha frequentato la St. Charles Grammar School a North Hollywood. All’età di 14 anni, è entrato nel Los Angeles College, il seminario preparatorio dell’arcidiocesi. Ha proseguito la sua formazione presso il Seminario di Nostra Signora Regina degli Angeli e il Seminario di San Giovanni a Camarillo. Ordinato sacerdote il 1° maggio 1962 dal Vescovo Aloysius J. Willinger, Mahony fu inizialmente assegnato alla Cattedrale di San Giovanni di Fresno. Ha proseguito i suoi studi presso la Catholic University of America, conseguendo un master in lavoro sociale nel 1964. Durante la sua prima carriera, Mahony ha ricoperto diverse posizioni, tra cui quella di direttore diocesano di Catholic Charities and Social Service, parroco e direttore esecutivo del Catholic Welfare Bureau. Si è occupato anche di questioni civili, facendo parte di commissioni che si occupano di opportunità economiche, riabilitazione degli alcolisti e sviluppo urbano. Nel 1975, Mahony è stato nominato Vescovo ausiliario di Fresno. Ha poi servito come Vescovo di Stockton dal 1980 al 1985. Il 16 luglio 1985, Papa Giovanni Paolo II ha nominato Mahony Arcivescovo di Los Angeles. Durante il suo mandato, ha riorganizzato l’arcidiocesi in cinque suddivisioni amministrative e ha supervisionato la controversa costruzione della Cattedrale di Nostra Signora degli Angeli, inaugurata nel 2002. Mahony è stato creato Cardinale-Presbitero dei Santi Quattro Coronati da Papa Giovanni Paolo II nel concistoro del 28 giugno 1991. Ha partecipato ai conclavi che hanno eletto i Papi Benedetto XVI e Francesco. Nel corso della sua carriera, Mahony ha fatto parte di numerosi comitati della Conferenza dei Vescovi Cattolici degli Stati Uniti e ha ricoperto incarichi in vari consigli e congregazioni del Vaticano. Mahony ha affrontato critiche severe per la sua gestione dei casi di abusi sessuali all’interno dell’arcidiocesi, che ha portato a un accordo record di 660 milioni di dollari per 508 vittime nel 2007. La sua gestione della crisi è stata giudicata estremamente scadente, caratterizzata da un modello di insabbiamento e di cattiva gestione dei casi di abuso che ha attraversato decenni. Le sue azioni e inazioni hanno portato numerose vittime a subire abusi che avrebbero potuto essere evitati. Nel 1997, Mahony ha avuto anche un’importante disputa pubblica con Madre Angelica, fondatrice di EWTN, dopo che lei ha criticato in televisione una lettera pastorale di Mahony, suggerendo che non enfatizzava sufficientemente la Presenza Reale di Gesù nell’Eucaristia.1 Il 27 febbraio 2011, Mahony ha raggiunto l’età pensionabile obbligatoria e gli è succeduto l’Arcivescovo José Horacio Gómez.

He pursued higher education at St. Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, earning a Bachelor of Arts in philosophy in 1952. He then received a Licentiate in Sacred Theology from St. Mary’s University in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1956.

One of his most significant accomplishments was the revitalization of Sacred Heart Major Seminary. Under his leadership, the seminary developed a faculty considered to be among the finest in the country and expanded its student body to include both seminarians and lay people. Maida was also particularly well known for his visionary approach to repurposing Church property. He participated in the papal conclave of April 2005 that elected Pope Benedict XVI after the death of Pope John Paul II. His contributions to the church include serving on various committees within the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) and other Catholic organizations. Cardinal Maida retired as Archbishop of Detroit on January 5, 2009. His retirement marked the end of a notable ecclesiastical career during which he also served as Superior of the Cayman Islands from 2000 to 2009.

127,Rolandas Makrickas,"Cardinal Rolandas Makrickas, the Coadjutor Archpriest of the Basilica of St. Mary Major, is a Lithuanian-born prelate and experienced Holy See diplomat who is esteemed by Pope Francis for his administrative skills especially in the area of finance. Born on January 31, 1972, in Biržai, Lithuania, Makrickas grew up during the Soviet era, which restricted religious practices, leading to his early religious education being private and brief. “We felt the persecution of the Church during the Soviet era quite strongly,” he said in a recent interview. As the youngest of five children, Makrickas initially considered a career in aviation and even flew gliders in his youth. “I was very attracted to flying, the opportunity to rise above the ground,” he has said. “However, I decided to choose the seminary, but I can fly even now — I’m happy to do it when I return to Lithuania.” Makrickas entered Kaunas Priest Seminary in 1990 and later studied philosophy and theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Panevėžys on July 30, 1996. From 1996 to 2001, he served as under-secretary of the Lithuanian Bishops’ Conference and headed the National Committee of the Great Jubilee of 2000. He earned a doctorate in Church history from the Pontifical Gregorian University in 2004. After studying at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy from 2003 to 2006, Makrickas joined the Holy See’s diplomatic service on July 1, 2006 — an experience which he says radically changed his life. His diplomatic assignments included postings in Bolivia, Georgia, Sweden, the United States, Gabon, and Congo. He was stationed in Georgia during the Russo-Georgian war and while he was working at the apostolic nunciature in Washington DC (2013-2017) he was involved in organizing Pope Francis’  2015 visit to the United States, working under the oversight of then-nuncio, Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò. The following two years, he served as chargé d’affaires in Gabon, and counselor in Congo where he helped the Church provide social services and manage a construction project. In 2019, he moved to Rome where his administrative skills were further recognized and he became the first non-Italian to head the administration in the Section for General Affairs of the Secretariat of State. On December 15, 2021, Pope Francis, who has a special affection for the basilica, appointed Makrickas as extraordinary commissioner to manage the assets of the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. “The financial situation of this basilica became very difficult during the pandemic, and there were also structural administrative problems, so this is a new period of reform,” Makrickas said in 2024.1 “This is quite a job and requires collaboration and a lot of coordination with experts from different institutions.” While continuing the task, he was made titular bishop of Tolentino with the personal title of archbishop on February 23, 2023. Co-consecrators were Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Pollish Cardinal Stanislaw Rylko, Archpriest of St. Mary Major, and deputy secretary of state, Archbishop Edgar Peña Parra. A year later, he was named coadjutor archpriest of St. Mary Major. Pope Francis elevated Rolandas Makrickas to cardinal on December 7, 2024. On opening the holy door of St. Mary Major on January 1, 2025 — the fourth of five holy doors opened for the 2025 jubilee year — the cardinal said: “It will not be ideas or technology that give us comfort or hope, but the face of the Mother of God.” Archbishop Makrickas is multilingual and speaks English, French, Italian, and Spanish fluently.","• Theology/Ideology: Makrickas emphasizes a pastoral approach grounded in the Church's historical roots while advocating for reform and collaboration within the ecclesiastical community.

Born on March 7, 1952, in Marrakesh, Morocco, to French parents who returned to France shortly after his birth, Mamberti currently serves as the prefect of the Apostolic Signatura in the Roman Curia, a position he has held since January 2015. He pursued studies in public law and political science before entering the Pontifical French Seminary in Rome. On September 20, 1981, he was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Ajaccio, Corsica. Mamberti furthered his education by earning degrees in both civil and canon law. Mamberti’s diplomatic career with the Holy See began on March 1, 1986. He served in various papal representations, including Algeria (1986-1990), Chile (1990-1993), Lebanon (1996-1999), and at the United Nations in New York (1993-1996). His expertise in international relations led to his appointment as Apostolic Nuncio to Sudan and Apostolic Delegate to Somalia on May 18, 2002. In 2004, he was also appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Eritrea. In 2006, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him Secretary for Relations with States, effectively making him the Vatican’s Foreign Minister. In this role, he led numerous Holy See delegations at international meetings and conferences, particularly at the United Nations General Assembly and the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. In November 2014, Pope Francis appointed Mamberti prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, replacing Cardinal Raymond Burke. In January, 2015, Francis elevated Mamberti to the cardinalate. In July 2024, Cardinal Mamberti was designated as the cardinal who will pronounce the “Habemus Papam!” [“We have a Pope!”) announcement when a new pope is elected. This responsibility came to him after becoming the most senior cardinal in the Order of Deacons. Throughout his career, Cardinal Mamberti has been known for his expertise in international relations, particularly concerning Latin America, the United Nations, Africa, the Middle East, and Islam. His diplomatic skills and extensive experience have made him a valuable asset to the Holy See in navigating complex global issues. Drawing on that expertise, the cardinal has called for international law to be based on the dignity and nature of humanity, rooted in natural law. He advocates for the protection of religious liberty, human rights, and fundamental freedoms in international contexts. While he served as Secretary for Relations with States during Benedict XVI’s pontificate, some Rome diplomats believed the Holy See was not as “focused” as it had been just ten years earlier. Some of these diplomats pointed to Mamberti and complained about poor lines of communication, but many of these critics also wanted the Church to promote a “unified international agenda” more sympathetic to secular concerns and a globalist vision. Cardinal Mamberti is known to be a staunch defender of the right to life, the dignity of human life, and Catholic moral teaching in general. In January 2013, Mamberti gave an interview to Vatican Radio in which he defended the right to a conscience clause for Christian employers who refused services to homosexuals. Mamberti has expressed opposition to increasing secularism. He has also emphasized the importance of religious liberty and the autonomy of the Church. In his view, respect for freedom of conscience and religion is a condition for establishing a tolerant, pluralistic society. Cardinal Mamberti tends to be discreet, and as his role as Prefect of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura is primarily judicial within the Church’s internal governance, that may also explain why he made fewer public statements on some specific doctrinal or social issues.","• Theology/Ideology: Mamberti is an orthodox canonist who strongly advocates for religious freedom and the right to life, aligning closely with traditional Catholic moral teachings.

On June 28, 1964, he was ordained as a priest in the Cathedral of Vicenza by Bishop Carlo Zinato. Marchetto’s career in the Church hierarchy began to flourish when he was appointed titular archbishop of Astigi on August 31, 1985, serving as the Apostolic Nuncio to Madagascar and Mauritius. He was consecrated bishop in 1985 by Cardinal Sebastiano Baggio. Throughout his career, Cardinal Marchetto held several significant positions within the Church. He served as the Apostolic Nuncio to Tanzania from December 1990, and later to Belarus from May 1994. His diplomatic service to the Holy See culminated in his return to the Roman Curia as an official of the Secretariat of State in July 1999. In 2001, Pope John Paul II named him secretary of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People. After retiring from his position on August 25, 2010, Cardinal Marchetto dedicated himself to scholarly pursuits, particularly focusing on the hermeneutics of the Second Vatican Council. His expertise in this area has been widely recognized, with Pope Francis considering him “the greatest expert in hermeneutics” of the Council. Marchetto advocates a “hermeneutic of continuity” in interpreting Vatican II, which sees the council as continuous with previous Church teaching rather than a rupture — a view that aligns with Pope Benedict XVI’s approach.1 In 2006, Cardinal Marchetto made headlines by drawing attention to the connection between the World Cup in Germany and human trafficking for prostitution. Cardinal Marchetto is multilingual, speaking Italian, French, English, and Spanish.

131,Giorgio Marengo,"Cardinal Giorgio Marengo is an Italian prelate and one of the youngest members of the College of Cardinals who since 2003 has served as a Consolata missionary in Mongolia. Born on June 7, 1974, in Cuneo, Piedmont, Marengo joined the Consolata Missionaries and was ordained priest in 2001. He went on to study philosophy and theology at various institutions, earning a doctorate in missiology from the Pontifical Urban University in 2016. In 2003, Marengo began his missionary work in Mongolia, becoming one of the first members of his order to serve there. He spent 14 years in Arvaikheer, a remote area 450 kilometers southwest of Ulaanbaatar, where he established a small church and social projects. On April 2, 2020, Pope Francis appointed him Apostolic Prefect of Ulaanbaatar and titular bishop of Castra Severiana. Marengo’s most notable achievement is his work in building the Catholic community in Mongolia, which did not exist in 1992 but now numbers around 1,450 faithful. Vocations have more than doubled since Marengo arrived, with priests increasing from 11 in 2003 to 25 in 2022, male religious from 13 to 30, and female religious increasing by a third from 23 to 33. Marengo has focused on interreligious dialogue, particularly with the Buddhist majority, and has emphasized the importance of understanding Mongolian culture and traditions. One of his significant social initiatives is the establishment of the House of Mercy, a haven for marginalized people in Mongolia. On August 27, 2022, Pope Francis created Marengo a cardinal, making him the youngest member of the College of Cardinals at the time, aged just 48. The appointment was a surprise, not least to Marengo himself, as the Pope had only met him the day before at a private audience in the Vatican. However, his elevation to the cardinalate came to be seen as a recognition of the Church’s mission in Mongolia and a sign of the Pope’s interest in the Asian continent. Marengo saw it as evidence of how important interreligious dialogue is to the Pope. The Italian cardinal is known for his approach to evangelization, which he describes as “whispering the Gospel.” This method involves building relationships and sharing the faith with discretion and respect for local culture. He first heard of the term from an Indian cardinal who used it to describe what the Church was doing in Asia. Marengo has said it presupposes an intimate relationship and means reaching the heart of people, being a “mission of depth” that isn’t superficial. Only when the heart of the culture can be touched by the Gospel, he believes, will it really bear fruit. In an interview with Agenzia Fides in October 2024, Cardinal Marengo spoke of the importance of specifically proclaiming the Gospel to those who do not know what it is. “This specificity must not be diluted, it must not be lost in an overly general discourse on mission,” he said. “To be aware of this specificity and to always take it into account seems vital to me for in this period for the entire action of the Church in the world and for its journey through history.” The Church’s mission, he said, is neither marketing work nor humanitarian service but a responsibility one receives with baptism. “The Gospel is not communicated as an idea or as one of the options on a menu. This is marketing,” Marengo said. Marengo has emphasized the importance of reverence for the Eucharist, and has focused on introducing new converts to prayer and deepening their faith. The Italian missionary was instrumental in preparing for Pope Francis’s historic visit to Mongolia in 2023, the first papal visit to the country. In a 2023 interview with the National Catholic Register prior to the visit, former Mongolian President and Prime Minister, Nambaryn Enkhbayar, noted Marengo’s achievements as a missionary in his country. “Marengo leads the Catholic Church in Mongolia with an estimated 1,300 Catholics out of a total population of about 3.34 million,” he said. “He speaks fluent Mongolian, a difficult language, which he mastered while living in Mongolia for more than 15 years, mainly in the rural area of the country.” The cardinal places great importance on interfaith dialogue, seeing it as essential for the Church’s presence in Mongolia where Catholics are a tiny minority. The Church under his leadership in Mongolia is involved in various projects related to education, healthcare, and improving living conditions; Marengo sees these social initiatives as a way to embody faith and Gospel values in society. The cardinal has spoken little about contemporary moral and pressing issues as his primary focus has been on his missionary work in Mongolia and the growth of the Catholic Church there. As well as his native Italian, Cardinal Marengo speaks English and Mongolian fluently.","• Theology/Ideology: Marengo emphasizes a mission of depth that respects local culture and traditions while specifically proclaiming the Gospel to those unfamiliar with it.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his discreet and relational approach to evangelization, Marengo effectively fosters interreligious dialogue and builds strong community ties.

Born on July 8, 1951, in Asunción, Paraguay, his educational background is diverse, having studied economics at the National University of Asunción for three years before pursuing advanced English in Washington, D.C., and philosophy at Oblate College in San Antonio, Texas. He later moved to Frascati to study at the International School for Priests of the Focolare Movement and completed his studies in philosophy and theology at the Pontifical Lateran University in 1981. Martínez Flores was ordained priest on August 24, 1985, by Cardinal Seán O’Malley, then bishop coadjutor of the Diocese of St. Thomas, US Virgin Islands. He served as a priest in the diocese of Saint Thomas from 1985 to 1994, first on St. Croix and then on St. Thomas. After being incardinated in the Archdiocese of Asunción in 1994, he became parish priest of the Sacred Hearts of Jesus and Mary parish until 1997. His episcopal career began on August 14, 1997, when Pope John Paul II appointed him as an auxiliary bishop of Asunción. He then served as the first bishop of the new Diocese of San Lorenzo from 2000 to 2007, followed by appointments to the Diocese of San Pedro and the Military Ordinariate of Paraguay. In 2018, he was transferred to Villarrica del Espíritu Santo while continuing as apostolic administrator of the Military Ordinariate. Martínez Flores demonstrated leadership within the Paraguayan Catholic Church, serving as president of the Episcopal Conference of Paraguay for two consecutive terms starting in 2018. His most significant appointment came on February 17, 2022, when Pope Francis named him Archbishop of Asunción. The pinnacle of his ecclesiastical career came on August 27, 2022, when Pope Francis elevated him to the rank of cardinal, assigning him the title of San Giovanni a Porta Latina. This historic event made Martínez Flores the first cardinal in Paraguayan history, a fact he views as a recognition of the faith of the Paraguayan people rather than a personal achievement. Cardinal Martínez Flores has strongly condemned abortion, calling it “abominable” and considering it a threat against the family. He strongly supports the synodal process promoted by Pope Francis. He considers synodality to be an important challenge for the Church, which implies “walking together” with the laity, bishops, priests and deacons. He has also praised how young people push the Church to be more synodal. He has also emphasized the importance of unity and communion within the College of Cardinals, recognizing the universal nature of the Gospel message. Although he has not spoken explicitly about environmental issues, the cardinal participated in an event called “Paraguayan Social Week 2023” that addressed topics such as production models, climate change and healthy eating, suggesting that he considers these issues important. Since his elevation to cardinal, Martínez Flores has visited Rome several times to promote the canonization of a Paraguayan blessed, to take possession of his titular church,  and to attend the funeral of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI. Martínez Flores has been actively involved in social welfare initiatives, particularly focusing on health care and support for marginalized communities, addressing the needs of the poor and advocating for social justice. Cardinal Martínez Flores’s elevation to the cardinalate is seen as part of Pope Francis’ efforts to create a more globally representative College of Cardinals, reflecting the diversity of the Catholic Church worldwide. Like many such choices, the cardinal’s views align closely with those of Pope Francis. Cardinal Martínez Flores speaks Spanish (his native language), English, and Italian.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Adalberto Martínez Flores advocates for synodality and social justice, emphasizing the need for collaboration within the Church and addressing contemporary issues.

135,António Augusto dos Santos Marto,"Cardinal António Augusto dos Santos Marto is a progressive Portuguese prelate whose theology and approach to Church reform closely match those of Pope Francis. Born on May 5, 1947, in the municipality of Chaves, in the diocese of Vila Real, Portugal, António was the youngest of four siblings, two of whom died before he was born, one of them in a tragic accident. Antonio was the product of an unintended but ultimately welcomed pregnancy. After he completed his preparatory studies in the minor seminary of Vila Real, Marto attended courses in philosophy and theology at the Catholic University of Portugal, as a student at the major seminary in Porto. He was ordained to the priesthood in Rome on November 7, 1971, while pursuing his doctoral studies in Theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University. During this time, he had the opportunity to study under Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, and completed his doctoral thesis in 1978, focusing on Christian hope and eschatology. After his return from Rome, he remained in the city of Porto, as professor of theology at the Catholic University. He was also prefect of discipline at the major seminary of Porto and head of seminarians for the diocese of Vila Real. His episcopal journey began when Pope John Paul II appointed him Auxiliary Bishop of Braga on November 10, 2000. He was consecrated as a bishop on February 11, 2001, appointed Bishop of Viseu in 2004 and then Bishop of Leiria-Fátima in 2006 by Pope Benedict XVI. Although he shares the same surname as two of the Fatima children, he is not related. Pope Francis elevated Bishop Marto to the cardinalate in June 2018. As Bishop of Leiria-Fátima, Marto had the honor of hosting two popes during their visits to the Sanctuary of Fátima: Benedict XVI in 2010 and Francis in 2017, the centenary of Our Lady appearing to the three shepherd children. From 2011 to 2014, Marto served as the delegate of the Portuguese Episcopal Conference to the Commission of the Bishops’ Conferences of the European Union, demonstrating his involvement in broader Church affairs. Cardinal Marto is known to be closely aligned with Pope Francis’s vision and approach to Church reforms. He has described himself as a “steadfast” partner in the Pope’s efforts to reform the Church and Roman Curia, aiming to make them “more like Jesus, who approached the people, who went out on the streets.” Pope Francis’ pilgrim Church, he added, “goes out to meet everyone, no exception, without any discrimination.” Cardinal Marto has a progressive and distinctly non-traditional approach to liturgical matters. He has criticized what he calls the “bulimia of rites and the anorexia of the Word,” lamenting an excessive focus on rituals at the expense of engaging with Scripture. The faith, he has said, “cannot be reduced to mere doctrine, or a set of rites, or rules of good behavior,” adding that the Church “must pay regard to the youth, realizing that they look for a spiritual dimension that is more profound than what was usually imparted before.” He does not appear to have spoken publicly on Traditionis Custodes but most likely agrees with its aim to establish the novus ordo as the one form of the Roman Rite. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Marto criticized a petition by 500 Portuguese Catholics calling on the Vatican to overturn the Portuguese Episcopal Conference’s decision to administer Communion in the hand during the pandemic. Having clarified that the signatories “are entitled to their opinion,” he lamented that traditionally-minded Catholics were “questioning the very faith of their bishops.” He argued against those who insisted on receiving on the tongue, citing Jesus’ own words: “Take and eat. Take, not ‘open thy mouth.’”1 Cardinal Marto also made headlines during the pandemic for his strong stance against those who viewed the pandemic as divine punishment. He called such views “unchristian” and attributed them to “ignorance, sectarian fanaticism, or madness.” The cardinal highly values popular religiosity, despite criticisms that it lacks theological depth or catechetical knowledge. He views it as “an expression of the inculturation of the faith in the simple people.” Cardinal Marto has spoken out against abortion, considering it an immoral practice, and has underlined his opposition to all forms of euthanasia. He has echoed Francis’ open border stance on migrants and refugees, criticizing the resurgence of certain types of nationalism which he said thrives on “fear and insecurity.” He also spoke out against the policy of separating families on the border between the United States and Mexico, said to have been implemented by the 2016-2020 Trump administration, classifying it as “immoral.” Marto criticized Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigano’s call on Pope Francis to resign in 2018 over Francis’ rehabilitation of the disgraced abuser Cardinal Theodore McCarrick. Marto dismissed the archbishop’s public denunciation as “an ignoble organized attack” on Francis, meant to “call into question his credibility and to create division within the Church.” He urged the faithful to remember the message of Our Lady of Fátima on the importance of unity within the Church, and to commit to the “culture of care” of which the Pope spoke, to protect children and combat every form of abuse. Pope Francis accepted Cardinal Marto’s resignation as Bishop of Leiria-Fatima in January 2022.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Marto embraces a progressive theology aligned with Pope Francis, advocating for a Church that engages with contemporary societal issues and prioritizes pastoral care over rigid doctrines.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his diplomatic approach and strong commitment to unity within the Church, often advocating for reconciliation and understanding among differing viewpoints.

136,Reinhard Marx,"Cardinal Reinhard Marx, an influential Archbishop of Munich and Freising and former head of Germany’s bishops, has been a controversial German prelate who has openly questioned established Catholic doctrine as well as faced criticism for his handling of sexual abuse cases. Born in 1953 in Geseke, North-Rhine Westphalia, Marx studied theology and philosophy in Paderborn and the Catholic University of Paris. Ordained to the priesthood for the archdiocese of Paderborn in 1979, he served as assistant parish priest and ecclesiastical assistant of the archdiocesan Social Institute “Kommende” in Dortmund. He earned a doctorate in theology from the University of Bochum in 1986. Three years later, he was appointed director of the Institute and served as professor of Catholic Social Teaching at the Theological Faculty of Paderborn. Appointed auxiliary bishop of Paderborn in 1996 by Pope John Paul II, Marx received episcopal consecration at the age of 43. Five years later, he was named Bishop of Trier, the oldest diocese in Germany. In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Marx metropolitan archbishop of Munich and Freising, a position Benedict held from 1977 to 1982. Marx, at the time, was considered to be on the conservative wing of the Church and Benedict elevated him to cardinal in November 2010. The cardinal participated in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis and almost immediately Marx began moving towards progressivism and heterodoxy. As he did so, Cardinal Marx became—and remains—one of the most influential Catholic prelates in Europe and the Vatican. From 2013 to 2023, he served as a member of the C-9 Group of Cardinals advising Pope Francis on Church reform. He headed the Commission of the Bishops’ Conferences of the European Union (COMECE) for two three-year terms until 2018. From 2014 to 2020 he served as the president of the German bishops’ conference. He continues to serve as coordinator of the Vatican’s Council for the Economy, overseeing financial reform of the Vatican. Eager to please an ever secular German society and beholden to considerable income from the state through the German Church tax, Marx has consistently sought to find compromises in the Church’s teaching.1 These pressures and his own heterodox leanings have influenced his actions. In May 2015, Cardinal Marx co-hosted a “secret synod” at the Pontifical Gregorian University which aimed to sway the Synod on the Family taking place that year towards normalizing same-sex relations in the Church based on a “theology of love.”2 Whether it has been about changing German Church rules to allow employment of “remarried” divorcees and homosexuals living in same-sex relationships (passed in 2015 and further relaxed in 2022) or pushing for Protestant spouses of Catholics to receive Holy Communion (approved in 2018), Marx has often won Vatican approval through strong-armed persuasion backed by the German Church’s vast wealth. This has been especially apparent in his push for the normalization of homosexuality and same-sex relationships in the Church. In 2018 he argued for the blessing of same-sex unions, and in a 2022 interview with the mass circulation German magazine Stern, he called for Church approval of same-sex “encounters.” Commenting in the same interview on his celebration of a Mass to mark “20 years of queer worship and pastoral care” in Munich, the cardinal said that ten or fifteen years earlier, he “could not have imagined that one day I would celebrate this service in this way,” but said that “for years I have felt freer to say what I think.” Marx has also joined other progressive prelates and priests, such as Jesuit Cardinal Jean-Claude Hollerich of Luxembourg, in calling for a change in the Catechism to effectively normalize homosexual activity in the Church, and has also said he supports the ordination of homosexual men. Cardinal Marx’s efforts to influence Catholic doctrine and morals have accelerated in recent years, often under the guise of reform and the sexual abuse crisis. He and his supporters argue that doctrine “can develop, change.” He has stated “the Catechism is not set in stone” and that one is allowed to doubt what it says. The German Synodal Way, which he helped devise and promote, was ostensibly about Church reform after a devastating historical study of abuse cases in Germany. But with the backing of other German bishops, Marx — who made headlines in 2015 when he said “we are not just a subsidiary of Rome”— ensured the multi-year process would be unilaterally and intentionally used to introduce a raft of secular values opposed to Church teaching. Critics of the Synodal Way, such as Cardinal Rainer Woelki of Cologne, said it threatened to create schism. German Catholic author and thinker Martin Mosebach criticized Cardinal Marx personally for having “a history of opportunism” and said he was “driving the Church into schism and secular meaninglessness.” On the issue of sexual abuse, in December 2020 Cardinal Marx surprised observers by establishing a charitable foundation called “Spes et Salus” (Hope and Salvation) to help victims of sexual abuse within the Church, donating 500,000 euros of his own money to start it. The foundation’s goal was to empower, encourage, and support abuse survivors on their journey towards self-empowerment and personal development. In 2021, Marx was accused of mishandling a case in the Diocese of Trier and denying access to key documents during an investigation into sex abuse. In the same year, Marx submitted his resignation to the Pope as a symbolic gesture to take personal responsibility for the Church’s institutional failures. Francis swiftly refused his request. In January 2022, a report on sexual abuse in the Archdiocese of Munich and Freising accused Marx of mishandling two cases of sex abuse.  Marx has been a vocal critic of certain political movements, such as the right wing Alternative for Germany party, stating that its positions are incompatible with Catholic teachings. He believes climate change has been as one of the two biggest challenges facing Europe, alongside the refugee crisis, and has called the need for a unified response to address these issues. Cardinal Marx caused further controversy in 2016 when he, as head of Germany’s bishops, and bishop Heinrich Bedford-Strohm, the head of the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD), removed their pectoral crosses on a visit to Israel. The incident sparked widespread criticism and debate in Germany with many viewing it as a denial of faith, a form of capitulation, and an affront to the many Christian martyrs of history who died rather than deny their faith by removing religious symbols. Since his offer of resignation in 2021, Marx has taken a lower public profile but he continues to wield considerable influence both in the Church in Germany and at the Vatican. From 2013 to 2021, the number of priests in the archdiocese of Munich and Freising fell from 1,216 to 960. Male religious during that period dropped from 539 to 462, and female religious declined from 2,159 to 1,461.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Marx advocates for a progressive interpretation of Catholic doctrine, emphasizing the need for reform to align with contemporary societal values.

138,Robert Walter McElroy,"Cardinal Robert Walter McElroy is a scholarly, Harvard-educated progressive American prelate closely aligned to Pope Francis’ vision for the Church but who has faced scrutiny and criticism for his views on Catholic social teaching and his own handling of sexual abuse cases. McElroy’s academic background is extensive. Born on February 5, 1954, in San Francisco, California, he attended Saint Joseph Minor Seminary in Mountain View, the high school seminary of the archdiocese. Upon graduating from Saint Joseph, McElroy decided it would be best to pursue his vocation in a college outside the seminary system and so entered Harvard College in 1972. He graduated three years later with a degree in American history before attending graduate school at Stanford and receiving a master’s degree in American history in 1976. McElroy returned to complete his ecclesiastical studies at Saint Patrick Seminary in Menlo Park, California and was ordained as a priest for the Archdiocese of San Francisco in 1980. He then went on to obtain a licentiate in theology at the Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley, California (1985). He was later awarded a doctorate in moral theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome (1986) and a doctorate in Political Science from Stanford University (1989). After ordination, McElroy served in various roles within the archdiocese, including as a parish vicar, personal secretary to the social progressive Archbishop John R. Quinn, and vicar general. His pastoral experience included serving as pastor of St. Gregory Church in San Mateo, California, from 1997 to 2010. In 2010, Pope Benedict XVI appointed McElroy auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of San Francisco. Five years later Pope Francis appointed him Bishop of San Diego. In August 2022, McElroy was elevated to cardinal, and on January 6, 2025, Pope Francis nominated him Archbishop of Washington D.C. Cardinal McElroy is known for his scholarly work and writings on Catholic social teaching. He has authored two books: “The Search for an American Public Theology” and “Morality and American Foreign Policy: The Role of Ethics in International Affairs.” He has also contributed several articles to America magazine, addressing key elements of Catholic social teaching. McElroy is widely regarded as a supporter of Pope Francis’s progressive teaching. He has been a vocal advocate for addressing social inequality, the cause of the homeless, supporting comprehensive immigration reform, and emphasizing the Church’s social justice mission. He affirms the Catholic teaching that life begins at conception, but does not believe abortion should be the sole preeminent issue for Catholic voters, arguing that climate change is also a crucial moral concern. In fact, he considers climate change to be an extremely serious moral issue, stating it has the potential of “stealing the future from coming generations.” He even argued that abandoning the Paris Climate Accord is “a far greater moral evil” than providing contraceptives in federal health centers. Cardinal McElroy has been a strong defender of migrants and has condemned efforts to deport illegal immigrants, clashing with President Donald Trump over the issue during Trump’s first term. He has voiced concerns about excessive partisanship in American politics, which he believes undermines unity and compassion towards vulnerable populations. He offered prayers for President Trump, Vice-President-Elect Vance, and others elected in November to Federal, State and Local Office.1 McElroy is a strong proponent of synodality in the Church. He sees it as a way to transform Church culture away from clericalism and secrecy towards greater listening and humility. He believes synodality is not about specific outcomes but about recasting Church culture for generations. Moreover, he said he saw the Synod on Synodality as the appropriate venue to overturn the Church’s core teachings, for example on the ordination of women deacons or St. Paul’s scriptural teaching on not receiving Holy Communion in a state of mortal sin. The American cardinal is a strong advocate for LGBTQ+ Catholics in the Church, calling for their radical inclusion. He has criticized what he has called a “profound and visceral animus” towards LGBTQ+ people, saying it is a “demonic mystery.” He has said he wants to make LGBTQ+ people “feel equally welcome in the Church as everyone else.” On Fiducia Supplicans which was rejected by many dioceses, especially in Africa, McElroy welcomed the Vatican declaration, saying its “diverging pastoral approaches” were a model of healthy decentralization rather than an obvious contradiction within the Church.2 He added, however, that such decentralization “must not obscure in any manner the rigorous obligation of every local church in justice and solidarity to protect LGBT+ persons in their lives and equal dignity,” nor prevent “genuine accompaniment to LGBT+ men and women in their lives of faith and pilgrimage.”3 McElroy supports expanding access to the Eucharist, arguing it should not be restricted only to “the best-behavers.” He cites Pope Francis’ view that the Eucharist is “healing and medicine for those in need of God’s help.” However, he clarifies he does not support completely open Communion for non-Catholics. McElroy fully subscribes to Traditionis Custodes and Pope Francis’ reasons for issuing it. In August 2021, he issued a letter outlining how his diocese would implement Francis’s decision to limit the celebration of the Traditional Latin Mass. He required that any priest wishing to celebrate the pre-Vatican II Latin Mass had to obtain prior permission from the diocesan bishop. He allowed the TLM to continue at one parish, St. Anne’s, which is designated as a personal parish for the Fraternity of St. Peter, but other parishes, such as St. Mary’s and St. Margaret’s, had their Latin Masses discontinued in accordance with Traditionis Custodes. He said he was actively working to accommodate those who wished to attend the TLM by seeking alternative non-parochial locations.  In general, Cardinal McElroy appears to align closely with Pope Francis’ more progressive approach to many issues, emphasizing “inclusion,” environmental concern, and a less rigid application of Church rules regarding the Eucharist and sexuality. On sexual abuse by clergy, as Bishop of San Diego, McElroy has taken steps to deal with the crime. He has recognized deeper systemic problems within the Church, including acknowledging the validity of the hypothesis that some bishops did not vigorously pursue abuse allegations due to their own personal sexual misconduct. He has called for addressing issues of clerical abuse and clericalism embedded in Church structures.4 However, he has been directly criticized for his own handling of abuse cases. McElroy is accused of delaying for a year the removal of a priest abuser from the diocese of San Diego who had admitted to what his victim had called “satanic ritual abuse.” McElroy is also accused of not properly investigating the case. In 2016, McElroy received a letter from psychotherapist Richard Sipe detailing allegations of abuse and cover-ups by prominent U.S. bishops, including then-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, who was later found guilty and laicized. McElroy doubted the accuracy of some of Sipe’s allegations and so their dialogue ended. McCarrick is believed to have helped orchestrate McElroy’s appointment to San Diego. The cardinal has been involved in the diocese’s approach to compensating abuse victims. Under his leadership, in June 2024 the Diocese of San Diego filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy to address over 450 sexual abuse claims. The diocese has faced allegations of hiding assets to avoid paying child sexual abuse claims, which it has denied. While McElroy has taken steps to address the abuse crisis, his handling of specific allegations and the diocese’s financial approach to compensation have drawn scrutiny and criticism.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal McElroy is a progressive theologian aligned with Pope Francis, advocating for social justice, climate action, and inclusivity within the Church.

From 1997 to 2000 he served as general pro-vicar of the archdiocese of Messina-Lipari-Santa Lucia del Mela, and from 1998 as canon of the Proto-Metropolitan Chapter of the Cathedral of Messina. He chose as his motto: Caritas sine modo. His dedication to social issues became evident when he was appointed director of diocesan Caritas in 1988. In 2000, Pope John Paul II appointed Montenegro as auxiliary bishop of Messina-Lipari-Santa Lucia del Mela. He received episcopal ordination on April 29 of that year, taking as his motto: Caritas sine modo. His leadership skills were recognized when he served as president of Italian Caritas from 2003 to 2008 and again from 2015. A significant milestone in his career came on February 23, 2008, when Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as metropolitan archbishop of Agrigento. Cardinal Montenegro, affectionately known as “Don Franco,” has been a tireless advocate for migrants, describing them as “a sacrament of God’s presence to us.” His commitment to this cause led to his appointment as president of the Episcopal Commission for Migration within the Italian Episcopal Conference and president of the Migrantes Foundation in 2013. One of the most significant events in Montenegro’s career was welcoming Pope Francis to Lampedusa on July 8, 2013, during the Pope’s first trip of his pontificate. In recognition of his service and dedication, especially on this issue, Pope Francis elevated Montenegro to cardinal in February 2015, further amplifying his voice on issues related to migration that has been an issue close to the Pope’s heart. The cardinal took part as a Synod Father in the 2015 Synod on the Family. He has expressed hope for the Church to recognize the family as the central pillar of human society but also to acknowledge people from different cultures and sexual inclinations, citing Pope Francis’ “Who am I to judge?” statement about persons with homosexual tendencies. Cardinal Francesco Montenegro sees the Eucharist and the liturgy within the context of social justice. For him the Eucharist is primarily a source of charity rather than a rite, as an inspiration for concrete actions of love and service towards others.

144,Stephen Ameyu Martin Mulla,"Cardinal Stephen Ameyu Martin Mulla, the Archbishop of Juba, is South Sudan’s first ever cardinal, known for his peace and reconciliation efforts in the war-torn country. Mulla was born on January 10, 1964, in Ido, Eastern Equatoria, Sudan (now South Sudan), in the diocese of Torit. He attended the minor seminaries of Torit and of Wau, followed by the Saint Paul National Major Seminary. He studied philosophy in the seminary of Bussere (Wau), from 1984 to 1987, and theology in Munuki (Juba), from 1988 to 1991. He received priestly ordination on April 21, 1991, for the diocese of Torit. Mulla pursued higher education at the Pontifical Urbanian University in Rome, where he earned a doctorate in dogmatic theology from 1993 to 1997. His doctoral thesis, titled “Towards religious dialogue and reconciliation in Sudan,” reflects his early commitment to peace-building efforts. After completing his studies, he returned to South Sudan and taught at the seminary in Juba, eventually becoming its rector. Mulla has served as a parish priest in several dioceses, and between 1997 until 2016, he worked in various positions: as a lecturer and dean of the Saint Paul National Major Seminary in Juba; teacher at the Comboni College for Adults and Teachers- Evening; lecturer and consultant of the local Sudanese organization for non-violence and democracy (SONAD); as founder, consultant and counsellor for the local humanitarian NGO, the Horiok Community Association and Development (HODA); and from 2013 to 2016, consultant and chaplain of Women’s Group. He has also served as a consultant and chaplain of the Women Advancement Organization at Guddele (WAO) in Juba; assistant vice chancellor for Administration and Finance of the Catholic University of South Sudan; and deputy director of the Institute of Applied Research and Community Outreach Catholic University of South Sudan (LARCO). On January 3, 2019, Pope Francis appointed Mulla as the Bishop of Torit, a diocese that had remained vacant for over five years. However, his tenure in this position was brief, as Francis soon appointed him to the role of Archbishop of Juba on December 12, 2019. Mulla’s appointment as Archbishop of Juba was met with significant opposition from some local groups. The resistance was reportedly rooted in ethnic divisions, with some members of the Bari community opposing the appointment of Mulla, who is from the Otuho ethnic group. Allegations of improper influence and unsuitability were raised, but Pope Francis reviewed these claims and confirmed Mulla’s appointment on March 6, 2020. Despite the initial challenges, Cardinal Mulla has played a crucial role in peace-building efforts in South Sudan as part of the Sudan Catholic Bishops’ Conference. In February 2023, he hosted Pope Francis during the pontiff’s visit to South Sudan, which brought him into the global spotlight. On July 9, 2023, coinciding with South Sudan’s twelfth anniversary of independence, Pope Francis announced Mulla’s elevation to the rank of cardinal. The appointment was seen as recognition of his efforts in promoting peace and reconciliation in the conflict-ridden nation. On September 30, 2023, he was officially created cardinal in the Vatican, becoming the first Cardinal from South Sudan. Cardinal Mulla has expressed positive views on synodality. “My hope is very wide,” he said ahead of the October 2023 assembly of the Synod on Synodality. “It is a way of participating, it is a way of communion, it is a way of mission together — in very simple terms — we should hope that this synod will bring a lot of things that will help us understand our faith in modern times. And we would like to say that the synod may be a way of solving the many problems, the many challenges, that the universal Church is facing in each local state and [universally].” While not directly addressing same-sex blessings, Cardinal Mulla likely opposes Fiducia Supplicans, in common with other African bishops. Homosexual acts are criminal offenses in South Sudan and in 2023, before he was a cardinal, Mulla told The New York Times that he was sceptical about Western views on sexuality being imposed on African cultures. “I believe that these situations cannot be equalized,” he said, adding that such matters should be treated differently from country to country. He emphasized respecting human dignity while noting that such issues were not a primary concern in South Sudan given other challenges the country faces. Cardinal Mulla has emphasized the importance of faith in South Sudan and sees his elevation to the cardinalate as recognition of the Catholic faith in his country. He views his role as serving not just himself but all of South Sudan.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Mulla advocates for peace, reconciliation, and religious dialogue while emphasizing the importance of local cultural contexts in theological discussions.

145,Gerhard Ludwig Müller,"The son of an automobile-industry worker, Cardinal Gerhard Müller was born in Mainz, Germany, and brought up in a devout Catholic family. He began his studies in Mainz and continued studies in philosophy and theology in Munich and Freiburg im Breisgau. In 1977, Müller earned a doctorate, having written his dissertation on the Protestant Dietrich Bonhoeffer’s contribution to ecumenical sacramental theology. His doctoral adviser was Professor, later Cardinal, Karl Lehmann, a student of Karl Rahner. The next year, in 1978, Müller was ordained a priest and began teaching in secondary schools while serving three parishes in the Mainz Diocese. His intellectual apostolate continued in 1985, when he became professor in Freiburg im Breisgau; the following year, Müller took up the chair of dogmatic theology at the Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. For the next sixteen years, Müller taught in Munich as well as in many other universities, while assisting at a local parish. From 1998 to 2003, he was a member of the International Theological Commission. In 2002, John Paul II appointed him bishop of Regensburg — the diocese in which Joseph Ratzinger had once taught — Müller began his apostolic work there in 2003. During his tenure as bishop, he engaged in many works to develop the diocese while serving on various congregations and councils in the Holy See. In 2012, Müller took up residence in Rome when Benedict XVI appointed him prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), which meant that ex officio he was also president of the Pontifical Biblical Commission, the International Theological Commission, and the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei. Pope Francis created Müller a cardinal-deacon in 2014 but declined to renew his five-year term as head of the CDF in 2017. Since leaving the CDF, Müller has gained an even more public and prominent standing, continuing his multilingual publications and expanding his apostolate around the globe. Intelligent and honest, Cardinal Gerhard Müller is a decisive and down-to-earth leader who will act courageously when necessary. Respected as a theologian, he has not always been as conservative as he might seem, and he himself dislikes the label, preferring to consider himself as simply “Catholic.” Formed under the tutelage of liberal German theologians such as the former head of the country’s bishops, Cardinal Karl Lehmann, Müller rose through the Church’s ranks with the support of Benedict XVI to reach one of the Church’s loftiest positions — prefect of the CDF — before Francis chose not to renew his mandate. Although liturgy is not his priority, he considers doctrine and pastoral care of equal importance, and he has encouraged Eucharistic devotion in a number of ways. He struggled to act coherently in the early years of the sexual abuse crisis but has been forthright on the issue since, and as bishop of Regensburg, he acted firmly and decisively with dissenting groups. Some questions arose in 2024 regarding minor allegations of financial propriety when he was prefect of the CDF, allegations that he strenuously denied. He is regarded as politically conservative. Generally viewed as theologically orthodox rather than ideological like some of his fellow German theologians, Müller has nevertheless been seen as unorthodox in some of his teaching, such as on Transubstantiation; and though he does not deny the dogma of the perpetual virginity of Mary, he offered teaching that ran contrary to widespread theological consensus. He also courted controversy through his interest in liberation theology, which he tried to separate from its Marxist interpretation. Generally, he takes traditional positions, strongly opposing a female diaconate and resisting changes to priestly celibacy in the Latin Rite, although he once favored exceptions to the late 1980s. Ardently supportive of the teachings of Vatican II and quite modern in his outlook, he has taken a hard line against the traditional Society of Saint Pius X. However, he has grown closer to Tradition in recent years and has been a staunch critic of the Synod on Synodality, the German Synodal Way, and what he perceives as departures from established Church teaching. He has also been critical of restrictions on the Traditional Latin Mass. Independent-minded, Gerhard Müller has been critical of globalism, “Agenda 2030,” and its protagonists whom he calls “strong powerful elites.” Within the Church, he is regarded as an intensely loyal friend and collaborator who has striven to avoid criticizing Pope Francis directly, though he has many questions about this pontificate, whose faults he mostly ascribes to Francis’ courtiers. He believes, for instance, that Francis is guilty of material but not formal heresy, but Francis appears to appreciate Müller’s loyalty and has awarded him various minor positions since dismissing him as CDF prefect in 2017. An honest broker, knowledgeable, well read, and “without a scintilla of nastiness,” according to an associate, Müller is unafraid to lead and make tough decisions. As well as his native German, Cardinal Müller speaks Italian, English and Spanish.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Müller is regarded as theologically orthodox yet has expressed unorthodox views on specific doctrines, demonstrating a blend of traditionalism and modernity.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his decisiveness and honesty, Müller is viewed as an independent-minded leader who collaborates loyally while avoiding direct criticism of his peers.  
• Power Base: His rise in the Church was significantly supported by Pope Benedict XVI, and he maintains influence through his extensive multilingual publications and global apostolate.  
• Core Motivation: Müller is motivated by a deep commitment to the teachings of the Church and a desire to uphold doctrinal integrity amidst contemporary challenges.","Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller is recognized for his theologically orthodox stance, while also expressing a unique perspective on certain doctrines that reflects a blend of traditionalism and modernity.

Mureșan pursued his education in Firiza and Baia Mare before being ordained priest on December 19, 1964 by Ioan Dragomir, auxiliary bishop of Maramureș.

One of seven children, he left South Africa as a young man, encountered the Franciscans in Ireland, and soon joined their order. In 1964, he completed a degree in Latin and English at the University of Galway, Ireland. From there, he was sent to the University of Louvain, where he earned a master’s degree in philosophy and theology.

In 1992, he was appointed archbishop of Durban. Reputedly fluent in six languages, he was created a cardinal by John Paul II in 2001. His engagement with modern social media has helped establish his reputation worldwide in recent years as a cardinal willing to name wrongs publicly in society.1 He participated in the 2014 Synod of Bishops and was the president delegate of the 2015 Synod of Bishops that focused on the mission of the family. Pope Francis accepted Cardinal Napier’s resignation as Archbishop of Durban on June 9, 2021, at the age of 80. He continued to serve as apostolic administrator until his successor was installed two months later. Considered a progressive-leaning centrist from the global south, Cardinal Wilfrid Napier has been on papabile lists since the conclave of 2005. Our research shows that concerning the liturgy, he has a devotion to the Eucharist, values reverence in church, and sees a drifting away from the Eucharist as a sign of lukewarmness in priests. He is a firm proponent of the reformed liturgy because he sees it as a better reflection of lay participation envisioned at Vatican II. He has been publicly critical of the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite, once equating the traditional Mass to a bygone age of “supreme clericalism.” Cardinal Napier has a reputation of being an attentive pastor and is a keen user of social media (especially X) to vent sometimes frank and unguarded opinions. The cardinal has often been a vocal supporter of Francis and believes synodality and collegiality — two of the central themes of this pontificate — are important for Church reform. But he has also been publicly critical of some aspects of this pontificate, notably aspects of the family synod of 2014 and the working document of the 2018 youth synod, where his interventions tended to be in defense of Africa against the imposition of Western secular values, especially on life issues, and in support of traditional marriage in the face of polygamy and the push to allow “remarried” divorcees to receive Holy Communion. He believes the West can learn from Africa, especially what the faithful of the continent can teach about seeing man created in the image and likeness of God. The South African cardinal opposed the German Synodal Way, concerned about its impact on the Church in Africa, and that its ideas that are not aligned with orthodox Catholic doctrine threaten Church unity. Cardinal Napier is fiercely pro-life and has been especially vocal against abortion, ideological colonization, and same-sex unions, although quiet on same-sex blessings. He has been consistent in his opposition to condom use to prevent the spread of HIV and AIDS. He has blamed the sex abuse crisis partly on the period after the Second Vatican Council and has said he would filter out homosexual candidates from the priesthood early on in the selection process. Although he has made mistakes in presenting the abuse crisis in the media, he has not been accused of abuse himself or of its cover-up. Cardinal Napier favors a sensible immigration policy that is welcoming while protecting host countries or regions and has often spoken up for the poor and against poverty. The cardinal actively engaged in anti-apartheid work but has also been critical of the ruling ANC government in the areas of democracy and education. Pope Francis kept Napier on beyond the age of 75 not only as archbishop but also as a member of the Vatican’s Council for the Economy, an indication of Francis’ trust in the cardinal’s commitment to financial probity. Staunchly loyal to Pope Francis, Napier has often criticized those who blame the Holy Father for any of the ambiguities, confusion and maladministration that critics say have been characteristic of this pontificate.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Napier advocates for a reformed liturgy that emphasizes lay participation and reflects the teachings of Vatican II, while opposing the traditional Mass for its clericalist tendencies.

148,Ladislav Nemet,"Cardinal Ladislav Nemet, the Metropolitan Archbishop of Belgrade, is Serbia’s first ever cardinal who has taught missiology and theology and once served as secretary general of the Hungarian bishops’ conference. He is a firm supporter of synodality and Francis’ Church reform. Born on September 7, 1956, in Odžaci, Serbia (then part of Yugoslavia), Nemet joined the Society of the Divine Word in 1977 and was ordained priest on May 1, 1983. Nemet’s education with secondary school at the Paulinum diocesan grammar school in Subotica from 1971 to 1976. He then joined the Society of the Divine Word and studied philosophy and theology in Pieniężno, Poland. He obtained a doctorate in dogmatic theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome in 1987. From1983 to 1985 he worked as a priest in Yugoslavia before going on to serve as a missionary in the Philippines from 1987 to 1994, focusing on university pastoral work. Subsequently, he held positions in Austria, including professor of theology in Mödling and collaborator of the Holy See’s mission at the United Nations Office in Vienna. In 2004, Nemet became the provincial of the Hungarian province of his order, and in 2006, he was elected secretary general of the Hungarian bishops’ conference. His episcopal journey began on April 23, 2008, when Pope Benedict XVI appointed him Bishop of Zrenjanin. He received episcopal ordination later that year from Cardinal Péter Erdő, Metropolitan Archbishop of Esztergom-Budapest, and served as Bishop of Zrenjanin until November 2022 when he was appointed Archbishop of Belgrade. He was elected Vice President of the Council of European Bishops’ Conferences (CCEE) in September 2021. Pope Francis elevated Nemet to the cardinalate on December 7, 2024, making him the first Serbian cardinal in the Church’s history. Throughout his ecclesiastical life, Nemet has demonstrated a commitment to education, missionary work, and leadership within the Catholic Church. Speaking to journalists on the day of the consistory, he said he fully backed Pope Francis’ reforms and synodality, saying they have been needed for the past 200 years since the Council of Trent. He did not think they undermined the Church’s hierarchy, saying the “centralization and absolutization” that was imposed around the year 1075 “isn’t the only proper way of understanding hierarchy.” He said he was very pleased that the idea of “common baptism” emerged during the Synod on Synodality, which to him means it is “not anymore about the threefold ministry of Jesus” but rather that “Jesus is something and we are something else.” Jesus, he continued, let the Church he founded be led by the Holy Spirit “and if the Holy Spirit guides us towards a female diaconate, I will say, ‘Okay, that’s my Church.’”1 Asked in March 2025 why he thought fewer Catholics were declaring themselves Catholic in Hungary, Nemet said he believed it could be due to “several reasons,” one being “a general phenomenon that believers are less attached to the institutionalized Church today,” and the other because the Church “could be more outspoken on certain issues.” Perhaps, the cardinal said, “the Catholic Church should stand up for migrants, LGBTQ rights, and the rights of remarried people.”  As for the qualities needed to be Pope, he said he must be “a man of prayer,” adding light-heartedly that he must also “still be a Catholic and, according to canon law, he must be a male.” Nemet is known for his linguistic abilities. He is fluent in Hungarian and Serbian, and also speaks English, German, Polish, Italian, and Croatian.","• Theology/Ideology: Nemet is a strong advocate for synodality and Church reform, aligning closely with Pope Francis' vision for a more inclusive and participatory Church.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is recognized for his collaborative spirit and openness to dialogue, making him a diplomatic figure capable of bridging diverse perspectives within the Church.  
• Power Base: As the first Serbian cardinal and a prominent leader in the Council of European Bishops’ Conferences, Nemet holds significant influence in Eastern Europe and among progressive factions within the Church.  
• Core Motivation: His primary drive is to promote a Church that reflects the teachings of Jesus through inclusivity and responsiveness to contemporary societal issues, such as migration and LGBTQ rights.","Cardinal Ladislav Nemet, as the first Serbian cardinal and a notable leader within the Council of European Bishops' Conferences, champions synodality and Church reform in alignment with Pope Francis' vision for an inclusive Church.

149,Pierre Nguyên Văn Nhon,"Cardinal Pierre Nguyên Văn Nhon is a retired Vietnames prelate who held numerous leadership roles in the Church and is known for his education and pastoral work. Born on April 1, 1938, in Đà Lat, Vietnam, Nguyên Văn Nhon began his journey by studying philosophy and theology at Pius X Pontifical College in Đà Lat from 1958 to 1968, culminating in his ordination as a priest on December 21, 1967. Following his ordination, Nguyên Văn Nhon dedicated himself to education and pastoral work. He taught at the Simon Hòa Minor Seminary for four years before becoming the rector of the Minh Hòa Major Seminary from 1972 to 1975. His pastoral duties expanded as he served as the parish priest of the cathedral for over 15 years, from 1975 to 1991, during which time he also held positions as dean of the deaconry of Đà Lat and vicar general of the diocese. Nguyên Văn Nhon’s episcopal career began on December 3, 1991, when he was ordained as Coadjutor Bishop of Đà Lat. He became the Bishop of Đà Lat on March 23, 1994, a position he held until 2013. During his tenure as bishop, he took on significant roles within the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Vietnam (CBCV), including presiding over the Commission for the Laity from 1992 to 1995 and serving as the CBCV president for two terms from 2007 to 2013. His leadership in the Church continued to grow as he was appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Hanoi on April 22, 2010. Just weeks later, on May 13, 2010, he succeeded Archbishop Joseph Ngô Quang Kiêt as the Archbishop of Hanoi. Nguyên Văn Nhon’s service and dedication to the Church were further recognized when Pope Francis created and proclaimed him cardinal in the consistory of February 15, 2015, assigning him the Title of San Tommaso Apostolo (St. Thomas the Apostle). In addition to his roles within Vietnam, Cardinal Nguyên Văn Nhon has participated in international Church affairs, including the Synod of Bishops for Asia in 1998. He has also been appointed to serve on important Vatican bodies, such as the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples and the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace in April 2015. Cardinal Nguyên Văn Nhon’s tenure as Archbishop of Hanoi concluded on November 17, 2018, when Pope Francis accepted his resignation.

150,Vincent Gerard Nichols,"Vincent Gerard Nichols, the Archbishop of Westminster, is a long-serving progressive-leaning prelate of the Church in England and Wales who has had a special concern for issues related to assisted dying, human trafficking, and pastoral care for migrants and refugees. Born on November 8, 1945, in Crosby, Lancashire, England, he began his journey to priesthood by studying at the Venerable English College in Rome from 1963 to 1970, earning licenses in both philosophy and theology from the prestigious Gregorian University. He was ordained as a priest on December 21, 1969, in Rome. Following his ordination, Nichols took on leadership roles in pastoral care, particularly in Liverpool, where in 1979, he was appointed vice-chancellor of the archdiocese. A year later, he became the director of the Upholland Northern Institute, further solidifying his role in Catholic education and governance. Nichols continued his education, earning an MA in Theology from Manchester University between 1970 and 1971, and later, an M.Ed from Loyola University in Chicago in 1974. Then-Father Nichols worked closely with Derek Worlock, the Archbishop of Liverpool from 1976 until 1996, who critics called a “dangerous radical” for his positions, but which Worlock justified through the lens of Catholic social teaching. After completing his further studies, Nichols quickly rose through the ranks of the Catholic Church. In 1984, he was appointed general secretary of the Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales, a significant early milestone in his career. In 1992, at the age of 46, he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Westminster, becoming the youngest Catholic bishop in the UK at the time. As Auxiliary, he was responsible for the pastoral care of the northern area of the archdiocese, and he participated in multiple synods in Rome, covering topics such as consecrated life, Oceania, and Europe. Upon the death of Cardinal Hume, Nichols was appointed chief administrator of the archdiocese of Westminster. His influence continued to grow, and in 2000 he was appointed the Archbishop of Birmingham. Nine years later, in 2009, he reached the highest ecclesiastical position in England and Wales when Pope Benedict XVI chose him to be Archbishop of Westminster. That same year, he was also elected president of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of England and Wales. In 2014, Pope Francis elevated him to the rank of Cardinal. Throughout his career, Cardinal Nichols has represented the Catholic Church at significant national events, including the services following the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the coronation of King Charles III. He has also been instrumental in forging strong relationships with the Church of England and other faith groups. His influence extended beyond the UK as he served on various Vatican congregations and commissions. On life issues, Cardinal Nichols, along with other faith leaders, has warned of the risks posed by assisted suicide legislation, especially to vulnerable people. In an October 2024 letter intended for distribution in his diocesan churches, Nichols urged Catholics to lobby their Members of Parliament to oppose proposed modifications to allow assisted suicide. The cardinal expressed concerns that the suggested alterations could transform the role of healthcare providers from a duty of care to a “duty to kill.”1 In 2021, Cardinal Nichols praised a woman with Down syndrome who challenged the UK’s abortion law allowing termination up to birth for unborn children with disabilities. He criticized the current UK abortion law, stating that it deals with “codified rights rather than innate human dignity.” Nichols has also regularly expressed support for migrants and refugees, emphasizing the need for fair and humane treatment. He has also played a significant role in the Santa Marta Group initiative on human trafficking, serving as its president. Both issues are of keen interest to Pope Francis. Cardinal Nichols’ overall stance on these life issues is grounded in Catholic teaching on defending the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death. He advocates protecting vulnerable individuals, promoting palliative care, and recognizing the inherent dignity of all human beings, regardless of their abilities or stage of life. The cardinal has been mostly tolerant of the traditional Latin Mass in the archdiocese, even after the 2021 publication of Traditionis Custodes, but in 2024 he declined to give permission for the old Latin rite celebration of the Easter Triduum in Westminster, making it the first time since the 1990s that the Easter Triduum would not be celebrated in the archdiocese according to the vetus ordo. Given his past sympathies for the old rite, some believe Nichols’ decision was strategic so that other old rite Masses in the diocese could continue for the rest of the liturgical year. Aside from his defense of Church teaching and his many achievements, Cardinal Nichols has faced considerable controversy regarding his handling of sexual abuse cases within the Church. In 2020, the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) heavily criticized him for failing to show adequate compassion towards abuse victims, alleging that he prioritized the Church’s reputation over the well-being of the victims. His time as Archbishop of Birmingham also came under scrutiny, with accusations that he mishandled abuse complaints and did not respond properly to victims. Nichols was further criticized for his response to media coverage, particularly for complaining to the BBC in 2003 about its reporting on abuse cases, rather than addressing the root issues. The IICSA report concluded that Cardinal Nichols “did not always exercise the leadership expected of a senior member of the Church,” suggesting that at times, he was more concerned with protecting the Church’s image. These findings led to public calls for his resignation, though Nichols has maintained his position, stating that he will not step down. Despite offering formal apologies, the controversies surrounding his approach to handling abuse scandals have continued to overshadow his other significant work within the Catholic Church in recent years. During his tenure at Westminster, the number of priests in the archdiocese fell from 629 in 2010 to 488 in 2022. Over the same period, the number of male religious also dropped, from 356 to 321, and the number of female religious significantly fell by over half, from 1,109 to 465.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Nichols advocates for the sanctity of human life from conception to natural death, emphasizing the importance of dignity for all individuals, including vulnerable populations.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his diplomatic skills and ability to forge strong relationships across different faiths, balancing progressive values with traditional Church teachings.  
• Power Base: As the Archbishop of Westminster and a prominent figure in the Catholic Bishops’ Conference, Nichols wields significant influence within the Church in England and Wales and on various Vatican congregations.

151,John Njue,"Cardinal John Njue is a retired Archbishop of Nairobi who has been a strong defender of life and family values and generally taken a conservative stance on social and moral issues. Born on January 1, 1946, in Kiriari Village, Embu District, Kenya, he was baptized in 1948 and began his primary education in 1952. Njue’s path to priesthood started early, encouraged by his teacher and a renowned catechist. He pursued his studies in Rome, earning a Master’s degree in Philosophy from the Pontifical Urbaniana University in 1969 and a Masters in Theology from Lateran University in 1974. Njue was ordained as a priest on January 6, 1973, by Pope Paul VI in St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Upon returning to Kenya, he served in various capacities, including as a parish priest , seminary rector, and professor of philosophy. His leadership qualities were recognized early, leading to his appointment as the first Bishop of Embu on June 9, 1986, at the age of 40. Njue’s ascent in the Church hierarchy continued with his appointment as Coadjutor Archbishop of Nyeri in 2002. In October, 2007, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as the Archbishop of Nairobi. Just over a month later, Njue was elevated to the rank of Cardinal, becoming only the second Kenyan to hold this position after the late Maurice Michael Cardinal Otunga. Throughout his career, Cardinal Njue has held several significant positions. He served as the Chairman of the Kenya Episcopal Conference from 2006 to 2015. He has also chaired various commissions, including the Episcopal Commission for Major Seminaries in Kenya and the Justice and Peace Commission. He took part in both the 2014 and 2015 Synods on the Family, and the conclave that elected Pope Francis. Njue’s tenure as Archbishop of Nairobi was marked by significant developments. He prioritized financial independence for the Church, helping to establish the Caritas Microfinance Bank. Under his leadership, numerous churches and church structures were constructed, including the Cardinal Otunga Plaza and a new building for Radio Maria. On the Eucharist and the liturgy, Cardinal Njue has emphasized the importance of attending Mass in person, stating that watching live-streamed Masses is not sufficient. He has stressed that the Sunday Mass obligation is rooted in divine law and cannot be changed. He has been a vocal opponent of abortion, stating that “abortion is killing an unborn baby” and he has led Catholics in Kenya in fighting against efforts to legalize abortion. The cardinal wrote pastoral letters affirming the Church’s stance against abortion and vowed that the Catholic Church would resist any moves to legalize it in Kenya. In 2013, Njue expressed his strong opposition to same-sex relationships. In response to then-US President Barack Obama’s support for gay rights in Africa, Njue stated that the United States had “ruined their own societies” and that he did not think “God was making a mistake when he created Adam and Eve.” He has rejected calls to decriminalize homosexuality in Kenya, and makes “no apology” for his stance. He believes allowing same sex relations “ruins moral fabric of societies” and is against biblical teachings. Like many in Africa, Cardinal Njue has expressed scepticism towards foreign-developed vaccines, urging Kenyans to treat them with caution. He has suggested that foreign entities pushing vaccines in Kenya may have “hidden negative agendas.” However, he noted that the Catholic Church is not against vaccines in general, but questions their sources and intentions. In 2016, Cardinal Njue surprisingly signed up for the UN “HeforShe” campaign that sought to build a global solidarity movement for gender equality. The cardinal endorsed the campaign during the Annual General Meeting of the Catholic Men Association of the Archdiocese of Nairobi, saying: “The Catholic Church has never shied away from issues of gender inequalities that face our society today. This inequality exists even in the Church because men and women sometimes forget they cannot be fully human without one another. We are all equal in the eyes of God,” the cardinal stressed. In particular, he urged men to mentor boys. “I wish to remind you, our dear fathers, that you have a responsibility to head your homes, lead and guide your families,” he said. “This is a role that cannot be fulfilled effectively without mentoring the future generation,” he said, adding that it is a “responsibility that you cannot give to someone else; it is your primary responsibility.” The cardinal was criticized for allegedly failing to take a firm stand during the 2007/2008 post-election violence in Kenya, when hundreds of people were killed. Cardinal Njue retired as Archbishop of Nairobi on January 4, 2021, at the age of 75, but remains an influential voice in the Church in Kenya and continues to serve as a member of the Dicastery for the Evangelization. In September 2024, the archdiocese of Nairobi dismissed rumors that the cardinal had died or was seriously ill. Shortly before the 2025 Conclave, Cardinal Njue said he would not be participating in the election of the new pope due to ill health.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Njue strongly defends conservative Catholic teachings, particularly on issues of life, family values, and moral integrity.

152,Kazimierz Nycz,"Cardinal Kazimierz Nycz was born in Stara Wieś, Silesia. He earned a Ph.D. in theology from the Catholic University of Lublin in 1981. After many years as a lecturer and vice-rector of the seminary, he was appointed auxiliary bishop of Krakow by Pope John Paul II in 1988. He served as Auxiliary Bishop of Krakow from 1988 to 2004, and then as Diocesan Bishop of Koszalin-Kolobrzeg (2004-2007). From 2007 until late 2024, he served as Archbishop Metropolitan of Warsaw and Ordinary of the Eastern Rite faithful in Poland. In 2010, Benedict XVI elevated him to the cardinalate. He is involved in numerous activities for the Church, including the Polish Bishops’ Conference, where he has served as chairman of the Catholic Education Commission. He was in charge of organizing the late Pope John Paul’s trips to Poland and during the Communist era was reportedly under close secret police surveillance from 1978 until 1986. In 2023, Cardinal Nycz resigned early as archbishop due to ill health (he doesn’t turn 75 until 2025). Pope Francis accepted his resignation on November 4, 2024, appointing as his successor Archbishop Adrian Galbas, who was installed on December 14, 2024. Cardinal Nycz is rated as a moderately progressive bishop in Poland, because for years he distanced himself from conservative, popular Catholic movements such as Radio Maryja. As the Metropolitan of Warsaw, he not infrequently gave interviews to media hostile to the Church. Only in recent years, when he began to speak out more frequently about same-sex unions, divorce or abortion, have his words aroused opposition from the left. He served as a bishop for many years, including as bishop of Warsaw since 2007 (a position often regarded as “the voice of the Church in Poland”) and yet his teaching never became the cause of either attacks from outside or controversy within the Church. In recent years he has been heavily involved in engaging the faithful to participate in the synodal process. He did not lend himself to intra-Church discussions on Communion for “remarried” divorcees, was moderately critical of the German synodal path, and vague on the blessing of homosexual couples. He was enthusiastic about Pope Francis’ change to the Catechism on the death penalty. Nycz seemed to enjoy Pope Francis’ confidence as the he entrusted him to hold other bishops accountable on issues of sex scandals. There is a slim chance that Cardinal Nycz could be elected pope. He resigned on grounds of ill health and his condition is apparently deteriorating. Even so, if elected, Polish sources say he would “probably be a very moderate pope.” In a book called Priests and the Security Service, Cardinal Nycz is depicted as a totally incorruptible cleric during the Communist era and a headache for the secret police who had spent years fruitlessly trying to recruit him or find something with which he could be blackmailed.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Nycz is regarded as a moderately progressive bishop who has distanced himself from conservative Catholic movements and engaged with contemporary issues such as same-sex unions and divorce.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He has maintained a reputation for being incorruptible and non-controversial, successfully navigating both church and secular media landscapes.  
• Power Base: As the former Archbishop Metropolitan of Warsaw and a long-serving bishop, he holds significant influence within the Polish Bishops' Conference and among the Eastern Rite faithful in Poland.

153,Dieudonné Nzapalainga,"Cardinal Dieudonné Nzapalainga was the youngest member of the College of Cardinals when Pope Francis elevated him to the cardinalate in 2016 at the relatively young age of 49. He also was the first ever prelate from the Central African Republic (CAR) to receive the red hat, and the first churchman born after the Second Vatican Council to be elevated to the College of Cardinals. Known as a tireless peacemaker in a country wracked by internal conflict, Pope Francis chose to elevate the Central African archbishop to the cardinalate after visiting the CAR at the height of its civil war in 2015. Dieudonné Nzapalainga was born on March 14th, 1967, in Mbomou, in the CAR diocese of Bangassou. The fifth of 10 children, he was baptized Dieudonné which means “given by God” or “gift of God.” Nzapalainga entered seminaries in different francophone nations — first the minor seminary of his local diocese, then a major seminary in Cameroon, and lastly at the Spiritan major seminary in Libreville, Gabon. He took his perpetual vows in the Congregation of Spiritan Fathers in 1997 and was ordained a priest in 1998. After obtaining a licentiate in theology at the Jesuit Centre Sèvres in France, Father Nzapalainga spent seven years in Marseilles as chaplain of an orphanage, assistant priest, and teacher. In 2005, he was recalled to the CAR to serve as regional superior where he quickly rose up through the ranks, becoming president of the Conference of Major Superiors of Central Africa from 2008-2009. Benedict XVI appointed him metropolitan archbishop of Bangui in 2012, receiving episcopal consecration from Cardinal Fernando Filoni. Cardinal Nzapalainga served as president of his country’s bishops’ conference from 2013 to 2019 and took part as a Synod Father in the 2014 Synod on the Family, the 2018 Youth Synod, and the first assembly of the Synod on Synodality in 2023. The cardinal is also on the Synod on Synodality’s Ordinary Council which oversees the organization of the synod. Cardinal Nzapalainga has made peacemaking his main priority in a country that has been torn by war for decades. He travels tirelessly across the country, including dangerous and remote areas, to promote and foster dialogue. He has focused largely on interreligious dialogue in an effort to help dispel the exploitation of religion by warring groups, and in 2013 founded an interfaith platform with an imam and Protestant pastor to help foster peace. Cardinal Nzapalainga’s tireless and brave peacebuilding efforts, which stem from growing up in a mixed religious family in poverty, have won him the moniker “Cardinal Courage.” “Healing,” Cardinal Nzapalainga wrote in his 2021 autobiography, “should start from within the hearts of ordinary persons and in the communities where they live.” His theology and doctrine are characterized by a strong emphasis on serving the poor, maintaining hope amidst suffering, promoting interreligious dialogue, and fostering unity within the Church. He draws personal inspiration and courage from the Blessed Sacrament. Vatican News described the cardinal as “one of the most listened-to persons on matters to do with the Central African Republic,” and he has great admiration for Pope Francis’ courage in promoting peace ever since the Pope visited the CAR in 2015 — a visit that Nzapalainga said was “like a light coming into the darkness” and “really like a balm of mercy and love.” He shares similar views to Francis, especially on migration. But on a personal level, his tenure as archbishop has not been trouble-free. In 2017, during his time as head of Caritas in the Central African Republic, the cardinal found himself in the midst of a clerical sexual abuse case having unwittingly appointed an abusive Salesian priest to a leading role in Caritas. The cardinal is considered to have handled the case appropriately, with the blame resting on Caritas and the Salesian Order. In the same year, Nzapalainga faced a separate problem: he found his name had been fraudulently added to a peace agreement that he did not support and which he did not personally sign. A smiling and joyful cardinal with an interest in philosophy, Nzapalainga is one of a number of African Church leaders who represent great hope for the faith found on the continent where the Catholic Church is growing, vocations are booming, and the bishops and clergy largely hold to the Church’s moral teaching on marriage and the family. Cardinal Nzapalainga is well aware of what the Church in Africa has to offer the universal Church, and therefore believes the number of African cardinal electors is insufficient. “In Africa, the Catholic Church has a strong voice,” he has said. “In our country, when bishops meet, people wait for their message.” But the cardinal himself is oddly reticent about speaking up on issues that currently preoccupy much of the Church, even about ideological colonization and the harm Western secular values are imposing on Africa. He has spoken little or not at all about the dangers of abortion, contraception, or those secular values that have entered the Church such as the same-sex agenda, or the push for women’s ordination. On priestly celibacy he appears to wish to uphold the traditional discipline, but only for now. Rather, peacebuilding and going to the margins of those caught up in his nation’s civil war are what preoccupies Cardinal Nzapalainga the most.

O’Brien’s leadership in the Church continued to grow as he served as rector of St. Joseph’s Seminary and later the Pontifical North American College in Rome. In 1996, he was ordained as an Auxiliary Bishop of New York. His experience with the military led to his appointment as Archbishop for the Military Services in 1997, where he ministered to 1.5 million Catholics in the U.S. Armed Forces and their families.

155,Seán Patrick O'Malley,"One of three children, Cardinal Seán O’Malley grew up in a devout Irish American family in Pennsylvania, United States. He recalls learning to serve Mass at six o’clock in the morning at the local Irish parish, even before he made his First Communion. At the age of twelve, he entered a Franciscan minor seminary and boarding school. He then attended Capuchin College in Washington, D.C., and the Catholic University of America, eventually professing vows as a Capuchin friar in 1965. After ordination as a priest in 1970, he earned a Ph.D. in Spanish and Portuguese literature, which he put to use as a professor at Catholic University and as a chaplain to Latinos in the Washington, D.C., area for many years. In 1984, John Paul II appointed O’Malley bishop, and he served the Virgin Islands in the episcopal capacity until 1992. O’Malley subsequently served in the sees of Fall River, Palm Beach, and eventually Boston. Created a cardinal in 2006 by Benedict XVI, O’Malley has been very active on apostolic fronts, including serving as apostolic visitor for many seminaries in Central America and the Caribbean, working to clean up dioceses harmed in the sexual abuse crisis, and being an active blogger. On April 13, 2013, Pope Francis made him a member of the Council of Cardinals to advise him on reforms of universal Church governance. On March 7, 2023, the Pope reappointed Cardinal O’Malley to the Council of Cardinals.  On February 17, 2018, O’Malley was reappointed by the Pope to a second term as head of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors. On June 29, 2024, Cardinal O’Malley turned eighty. He was on a number of shortlists at the last conclave, finding unexpected favor from Italians. Cardinal O’Malley’s bishop’s ring is inscribed with Mary’s words at the wedding feast in Cana: “Do whatever He tells you.” Combining interpersonal skills with administrative capabilities, O’Malley has extensive pastoral experience. He hews close to papal guidance, having extensively quoted Benedict XVI during his papacy, and then Francis under his. Francis both likes and has confidence in the cardinal. Seen as trustworthy to handle sensitive tasks, he is rightly praised for his work in correcting wrongs from sexual abuse in the Dioceses of Palm Beach, Boston, other parts of the world, and as president of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors. A center-right conservative, O’Malley has publicly opposed abortion and euthanasia as well as the use of contraception and in vitro fertilization. Defending the Catholic view of marriage and family life, O’Malley decided to cease Catholic adoption activities in his diocese rather than complying with state-mandated same-sex “marriage” and placing children in the homes of same-sex couples. At the same time, the cardinal has welcomed the Vatican document Fiducia Supplicans, which opens the door to the blessing of same-sex couples. While supporting the male priesthood, and calling for serious consequences to violations of celibacy, O’Malley has also said, “I’d love to have women priests” if not for the decision of Christ. He has criticized the American immigration system and emphasizes the positive qualities of Islam and its overlap with some Catholic values. He is an advocate of climate science. For O’Malley, the New Evangelization is a chief pastoral concern, which, for him, seems to mean preaching the gospel with gentleness and under the directives of the pope. He has urged the faithful to refrain from being harsh and judgmental when discussing divisive topics. He rarely enters into the fray when it comes to controversial matters or shares his views about serious topical issues. As a member of Francis’ inner circle of advisers, O’Malley has shown himself willing to correct the pope publicly when it seemed that the pontiff dismissed the plights of abuse victims in Chile, although O’Malley has generally supported Francis’ directives and gestures. On August 5, 2024, Pope Francis accepted the resignation of Cardinal O’Malley as Archbishop of Boston, after more than twenty years of service in the archdiocese. His successor, Bishop Richard Henning, was installed on October 31, 2024. As well as his native English, Cardinal O’Malley is fluent in Spanish and Italian and proficient in several other languages.","• Theology/Ideology: O'Malley embodies a center-right conservative stance while advocating for traditional Catholic values regarding marriage and family life, yet shows openness to dialogue on contemporary issues.

157,Peter Ebere Okpaleke,"Cardinal Peter Ebere Okpaleke is a Nigerian prelate noted for his pastoral qualities and evangelization who in 2017 prompted an intervention by Pope Francis after he was rejected by the diocese to which he was appointed bishop because he was not of their cultural group. Peter Okpaleke, and his twin brother Paul, were born on March 1, 1963, in Amesi, Anambra State, Nigeria. He attended local schools before entering the Bigard Memorial Major Seminary, in Ikot-Ekpene and Enugu, in 1983, where he studied philosophy and theology. Okpaleke was ordained as a priest on August 22, 1992, for the Diocese of Awka, after which he served in various pastoral and administrative roles within the Diocese of Awka. He held positions such as university chaplain, parish priest, diocesan finance administrator, and diocesan chancellor. From 1999 to 2002, he completed higher studies in canon law at the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in Rome. A significant turning point in Okpaleke’s career came on December 7, 2012, when Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as the Bishop of Ahiara Diocese. However, this appointment led to a major controversy when the local clergy and parishioners in Ahiara rejected him, arguing that he was not from their ethnic, linguistic and cultural group. They described his appointment as discrimination and “ecclesiastical colonization.” Despite being consecrated as a bishop on May 21, 2013, Okpaleke was never allowed to enter Ahiara Diocese due to the protests. The crisis escalated to the point where Pope Francis intervened in 2017, giving the priests of Ahiara thirty days to write to the Vatican pledging obedience or face suspension. Although the priests complied with writing the letters, they continued to reject Okpaleke. On February 19, 2018, Pope Francis accepted Okpaleke’s resignation as Bishop of Ahiara. He was widely praised for his humility in choosing to resign. Okpaleke viewed the events as God’s will and harbored no ill feelings towards those who rejected him. Two years later, on March 5, 2020, Pope Francis appointed Okpaleke as the first Bishop of the newly created Diocese of Ekwulobia which has a Catholic population of 609,818 (as of December 31, 2022). He was installed in this position on April 29, 2020. In his new role, Okpaleke has focused on emphasizing evangelization at the local level and encouraging a personal relationship with Jesus among the faithful. As Bishop of Ekwulobia, Okpaleke has articulated a vision for his diocese that emphasizes becoming “God’s family open to encounter and personal relationship with Jesus Christ and with one another, in faithfulness to the Church and the good elements of Igbo culture.” In a surprising turn of events, Pope Francis elevated Okpaleke to the rank of Cardinal in August 2022. This appointment came as a shock to many, given the earlier controversies in his career. Okpaleke himself expressed a sense of unworthiness upon learning of his elevation. Noted for his composure, articulation, and pastoral qualities, he has recommended to his flock the values of “love and respect for every person, male and female, as God’s children.” Cardinal Okpaleke places great importance on the Eucharist and liturgical participation. He has noted that Nigerians have a high Mass attendance rate, with 94% of Nigerian Catholics attending Mass at least weekly which he attributes to a traditional worldview that recognizes God’s presence in daily life; the role of the family as a “domestic church” where faith is passed down; and a sense of community within parishes. Okpaleke emphasizes that Catholics come to Mass “to encounter Christ in the Eucharist.” Okpaleke has published nine works ­­— books and monographs.1 Okpaleke has belonged to the Canon Law Society of Nigeria since 1995 and he currently the Chairman of the Canon Law Commission of the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of Nigeria.

Born on April 21, 1946, in Cretas, Aragon, Spain, he completed his studies in philosophy and theology at the seminary of Zaragoza and furthered his education at centers for missionaries in Leuven and Jerusalem. Ordained as a priest on September 20, 1970, Omella initially worked for the Church in Zaragoza and spent a year as a missionary in Zaire. His ecclesiastical career progressed rapidly, with Pope John Paul II appointing him auxiliary bishop of Zaragoza in 1996. He then served as bishop of Barbastro-Monzón from 1999 to 2004 and as bishop of Calahorra y La Calzada-Logroño from 2004 to 2015.

Cardinal Juan José Omella sees the Eucharist as essential in the life of the faithful, and advocates greater physical participation of lay people, both men and women, in the liturgical celebration. He sees positively Pope Francis’ decision to formally institute the lay ministries of lector and acolyte for men and women, considering it a “normalization” of a situation that already occurred in practice. During COVID-19, the cardinal promoted the adaptation of Eucharistic and liturgical celebrations to guarantee health security, implementing distancing and hygiene measures. Omella links the Eucharist with social commitment and charity. He has emphasized that the Eucharist must awaken in the faithful the desire to selflessly help others, being like Christ “good bread that feeds the world.” Cardinal Omella has taken a strong stance against abortion, condemning Spain’s recent reforms to abortion laws. He criticized the government’s decision to relax abortion restrictions, stating on Twitter: “No one bats an eyelid if a baby who has been in the womb fewer than nine months is martyred. But if a baby is born prematurely at five months old, there is an insistence its life saved. Yet breaking an eagle’s egg is forbidden!” The Spanish cardinal sparked controversy in 2023 when he responded to reports of sexual abuse within the Catholic Church in Spain. He rejected the conclusions of a report on pedophilia in the Spanish Catholic Church, calling the extrapolated figures reported by some of the media “lies” that are “intended to deceive.” He argued that the media’s interpretation of the official report, which suggested hundreds of thousands of victims, was misrepresentative. Omella also stated, “We will not tire of asking for forgiveness from the victims and working for their healing.” However, his approach was criticized by some victims who felt that proper investigations had not been conducted, particularly in his archdiocese of Barcelona.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Omella emphasizes the centrality of the Eucharist in the life of the Church and advocates for greater lay participation in liturgical practices.

160,Carlos Osoro Sierra,"Cardinal Carlos Osoro Sierra is an orthodox-leaning retired Archbishop of Madrid who has specialized in Catholic education and is well known for his pastoral sensitivity. Born on May 16, 1945, in Castañeda, northern Spain, Osoro Sierra has had a long and distinguished career in the Church. He initially trained as a teacher and taught for a year in Santander before entering the seminary. He pursued his religious education at the Pontifical University of Salamanca, earning licentiates in theology and philosophy. He further expanded his academic credentials with a licentiate in Exact Sciences from the Complutense University of Madrid and another in pedagogy from the University of Salamanca. Ordained as a priest on July 29, 1973, Osoro Sierra’s ascent in the Church hierarchy began when Pope John Paul II appointed him Bishop of Orense in February 1997. His career continued to flourish with appointments as Archbishop of Oviedo in 2002 and Archbishop of Valencia in 2009. In August 2014, Pope Francis appointed Osoro Sierra as the Archbishop of Madrid, a position he held until June 12, 2023. Pope Francis elevated him to cardinal in November 2016. Known for his ability to combine orthodox views with pastoral sensitivity, Cardinal Osoro Sierra was nicknamed “Don Carlos the pilgrim” by Pope Francis due to his frequent walks around his archdiocese to mingle with the people. He prioritized religious vocations and evangelization, launching initiatives to reach out to those disconnected from the Church. However, partly due to Spain becoming increasingly secular, the total number of priests continued to fall during Osoro Sierra’s tenure in Madrid, from 3,151 in 2013 to 2,549 in 2021. Male religious numbers dropped from 2,553 to 2,021, and female religious fell sharply from 7,060 to 5,185 over the same period. Osoro Sierra has held several significant positions within the Spanish Episcopal Conference, including president of the Commission for the Clergy from 1999 to 2005 and vice-president of the conference since March 2014. He was also appointed to various Vatican congregations, including the Congregation for Catholic Education, the Congregation for the Oriental Churches, and the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. Cardinal Carlos Osoro Sierra has a profound and transformative vision of the Eucharist and the liturgy, highlighting their central importance in Christian life and their impact on society. He sees the Eucharist is not simply a ritual, but a powerful force for transforming the world. This vision highlights the potential of the Eucharist to generate significant changes in both individuals and society at large. For the cardinal, the Eucharist is not a secondary aspect of faith, but a central element that must profoundly influence how we live our lives. Cardinal Osoro has expressed a firm stance against abortion which he has said represents a failure and he has urged more support for mothers. He has also said that the sacredness and inviolability of human life is not a matter of opinion. Man, he said, “is God’s possession” and “his life is directly protected by Him.” Respect for all life, therefore, “is an indispensable condition for a dignified social life.” In a 2022 letter to his flock, he recalled Jesus’ words: “You will be judged as you judge, and the same measure you use will be used against you” (Mt 7:2).” He said: “This is the measure of your humanity: how you care for others, whoever they may be, whatever their age, whether they are at the beginning of life or at the end of it. Being a Christian means living and having that loving gaze of God on man, which is the guarantor of his dignity. Always proclaim the dignity of man and respect his life. Live with these words from the Letter to Diognetus: “Christians are in the world what the soul is in the body.” While Cardinal Osoro Sierra has generally maintained a low profile in terms of controversies, in 2016 news reports suggested he had prohibited Cardinal Gerhard Müller, then prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, from discussing his book at a Madrid college because Osoro deemed it to be “a book against the Pope.” However, this was later clarified when Osoro welcomed Müller to a discussion of the book at a Catholic university in Madrid. Between 2020 and 2022, the cardinal became embroiled in a conflict regarding a Murcian priest who had questioned decisions related to the management of the foundations in the archdiocese. The case generated considerable tension at the core of the administration of the Archbishopric of Madrid and led to a re-evaluation of the management of ecclesiastical foundations in the diocese. There was no clear evidence that Cardinal Osoro was directly at fault in the “Foundations Case” dispute. As archbishop, he was ultimately responsible, but it appeared that he had been deliberately kept in the dark about aspects of the case. During the Catalonian independence crisis, Cardinal Osoro Sierra advocated unity and reconciliation. He stated on Twitter that Jesus encouraged “understanding and reconciliation, not the building of walls,” aligning with the Spanish bishops’ general stance urging unity while respecting the diverse opinions within the Catholic community.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Osoro Sierra emphasizes the central importance of the Eucharist in Christian life, viewing it as a transformative force for both individuals and society.

After serving as deputy parish priest at the Cathedral of Kaya, he pursued further education, obtaining a degree in canon law from the Pontifical Urbaniana University in Rome between 1978 and 1982. Upon returning to Burkina Faso, he held various positions within the Church, including vicar general, rector of the minor seminary, and national director of pontifical mission works. His rise through the Church hierarchy began with his appointment as Bishop of Ouahigouya by Pope John Paul II in July 1996. He was later appointed Archbishop of Ouagadougou by Pope Benedict XVI on May 13, 2009. Ouedraogo’s most significant elevation came on February 22, 2014, when Pope Francis created him a cardinal. Cardinal Ouedraogo participated in the Synods on the Family in October 2014 and October 2015. He has also served as a member of several Vatican dicasteries, including those for Evangelization, Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, and Interreligious Dialogue. In terms of leadership roles, Ouedraogo served as president of the Episcopal Conference of Burkina Faso and Niger from 2001 to 2007. In July 2019, he was elected President of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar (SECAM), a position he held until 2023. Cardinal Ouedraogo has been known for his outspoken views on social and political matters. In a Christmas homily, he criticized Burkina Faso’s wealth disparity, deploring the country’s domination by “a handful of citizens who hold the great part of its wealth.” He has also been a vocal advocate for the poor and marginalized, addressing issues of unemployment, injustice, migration, and poverty in his country. He is also known as a defender of women accused of witchcraft and he does not hesitate to censure those who, under the guise of tradition, practice witchcraft or accuse certain women of such practices. In Ouagadougou, he opened a shelter for women driven out of their villages for alleged witchcraft.  As archbishop, he was also committed to dialogue with other religions, notably Islam, and took part in prayers at the breaking of Ramadan. Cardinal Ouedraogo has expressed opposition to same sex “marriage” and used an Easter homily to criticize same-sex unions. The cardinal appears to support the Church’s focus on synodality. As President of SECAM, he encouraged the African Church to “stay the course of the Synod on Synodality consultation.” He views synodality as an important process for the Church in the third millennium, in alignment with Pope Francis’ vision. On October 16, 2023, Pope Francis accepted Cardinal Ouedraogo’s resignation as Archbishop of Ouagadougou.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Ouedraogo emphasizes social justice and the Church's mission to advocate for the poor and marginalized, aligning with the principles of synodality and interreligious dialogue.

162,Marc Ouellet,"Cardinal Marc Ouellet is a retired Canadian prelate who for well over a decade headed the Vatican Dicastery for Bishops, responsible for selecting candidates for episcopacies around the world. Raised in a practicing but not devout Catholic family in Quebec and one of eight children of a farmer, Marc Ouellet grew closer to the Catholic Faith as a teenager. Having attended college at the University of Laval, he entered the Grand Séminaire in Montreal and received a license in theology at the University of Montreal. Ordained priest in 1968, and having served in Canada for two years, he taught for two years in Spanish at Bogotá, Colombia, where he entered the Sulpicians in 1972. He was then sent to Rome, where he earned a license in philosophy from the University of St. Thomas Aquinas (the Angelicum) in 1974 while studying German at Innsbruck, Austria. After some time serving at a seminary in Canada, he returned to Rome and completed a degree in dogmatic theology at the Gregorian University in 1982. For the next twelve years, he taught in seminaries and served as rector in Colombia and Montreal until he came to teach theology at the John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and the Family in Rome (1996-2002). In 2001, John Paul II consecrated Ouellet a bishop and in the following year appointed him to be archbishop of Quebec and primate of Canada. In 2003, Ouellet was created a cardinal and since 2010 has been the prefect of the Congregation for Bishops as well as the president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. More recently, in 2018, Pope Francis elevated Ouellet to the order of cardinal-bishops, equating him in all respects to the cardinals who were given the title of a suburbicarian church. Cardinal Ouellet submitted his mandatory resignation from his curial positions upon reaching the age of 75 in June 2019; his resignation was refused by Pope Francis who accepted it three and a half years later, on January 30, 2023, specifying that this was in consideration of his having reached the “age limit.” He was replaced as Prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops and as President of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America on April 12 of the same year. A strong contender for the papacy during the last conclave, Cardinal Marc Ouellet was widely seen as papal material even if he modestly remarked in 2013: “I don’t see myself at that level, not at all.” His prospects of being elected pope have diminished in recent years, largely due to two cases that drew headlines. Several Canadian and French media linked the Pope’s acceptance of his resignation as prefect with allegations of sexual misconduct in his home country by two adult women, the second of which was made public on January 19, 2023 by the French progressive Catholic magazine Golias. Cardinal Ouellet denied the allegations. Then in April 2024, a civil court in Brittany, France, convicted Cardinal Ouellet in his absence as well as the other defendants for having expelled a nun, Sister Marie Ferréol, “without reason.” The court described her expulsion as “infamous and vexatious.” The conviction is being appealed. A mostly conservative-leaning prelate but with a somewhat modern, post-conciliar outlook that tends to change with the times and the popes, his episcopacy was formed through the challenging secular environment of Quebec, where he fearlessly resisted vociferous opposition to his steadfast adherence to Church teaching, especially on life issues. A strong defender of priestly celibacy in the Latin Rite, he is firmly against women’s ordination but favors giving women a greater role in the Church. He opposes same sex “marriage” and the redefinition of civil marriage, has praised Humanae Vitae, and has concretely supported migrants in difficulty. His views on Islam are moderate. The cardinal has a detailed knowledge of Latin America, having spent the first half of the 1970s as well as much of the 1980s in Colombia — a background that helped him to forge good relations with Pope Francis, whom he knew before his election as pope. Unity and communion (his episcopal motto is Ut Unum Sint — “That They May Be One”) are central to Ouellet, as is the Eucharist, which he sees as not only a celebration but also a “culture” needed to keep matters in balance. He is regarded as a world-class theologian but has appeared inconsistent on the issue of admitting Catholics living in irregular unions to Holy Communion. As a personally principled, prayerful, yet sensitive man, sometimes given to emotion and with concern for unity, he is reluctant to criticize in public and instead takes a diplomatic and low-key approach both to the papacy and, in the past, to his important previous role as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops. He is known to be a man of holiness, transparency, and humility, with a passion for life. He rarely gives interviews. Ouellet has a preference for solemn liturgies and wishes them to be about celebrating God, not people. He supported Summorum Pontificum and appears open and accepting of the Extraordinary Form of the Roman Rite. He has a devotion to Our Lady and is widely known to be a deeply spiritual prelate with a great sense of loyalty and a commitment to honor a position held — an attribute thought to be partly formed by an early love of sports, particularly hockey. Although someone with a deep love for the Church’s teaching, he is not considered doctrinaire and has a personal warmth and affability that those who know him say single him out as a true pastor.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Ouellet embodies a mostly conservative theology while advocating for a modern, post-conciliar approach that emphasizes unity, the Eucharist, and a commitment to traditional Church teachings.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is recognized for his diplomatic, low-key demeanor and emotional sensitivity, which allows him to navigate complex discussions without publicly criticizing others.  
• Power Base: With extensive experience in episcopal appointments and strong ties to Latin America, Ouellet has cultivated significant influence within the Vatican and among bishops worldwide.

163,Diego Rafael Padrón Sánchez,"Cardinal Diego Rafael Padrón Sánchez is a retired Venezuelan prelate who has dedicated much of his life to education and served as president of the Venezuelan bishop in the 2010s. Born on May 17, 1939, in Montalbán, Venezuela, Padrón Sánchez completed his early education at the minor seminary in Valencia and pursued his priestly studies at the Santa Rosa de Lima Interdiocesan Seminary in Caracas, where he obtained a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and letters. Padrón Sánchez’s academic journey continued with studies in group dynamics and youth pastoral care in Bogotá, Colombia. He further enhanced his theological knowledge by earning a degree in biblical theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and a diploma in Oriental Biblical Sciences from the Franciscanum Institute in Jerusalem, Israel. Ordained priest on August 4, 1963, Padrón Sánchez served in various parishes in Valencia. His career in education is noteworthy, having taught Spanish, literature, and Latin, and obtained a graduate degree from the Professional Institute of Teaching at the Pedagogical Institute in Caracas. In 1990, Pope John Paul II appointed Padrón Sánchez as auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese of Caracas and titular bishop of Gisipa. He was consecrated on May 27, 1990, in the Cathedral of Caracas. His ecclesiastical journey continued with his appointment as Bishop of Maturín in 1994. A significant milestone in his ecclesiastical life came on May 7, 2002, when Pope John Paul II appointed him metropolitan archbishop of the archdiocese of Cumaná. Padrón Sánchez served in this role until his resignation was accepted by Pope Francis on May 24, 2018. As part of his service to the Church, Padrón Sánchez has held several important positions within the Venezuelan Episcopal Conference. He served as president of the Commission for Laity and Youth from 1990 to 1996 and as president of the Commission for Catechesis and Biblical Ministry from 1996 to 2003. Notably, he was elected president of the Venezuelan Episcopal Conference for two consecutive terms, serving from 2012 to 2018. On September 30, 2023, Pope Francis elevated Padrón Sánchez to the rank of Cardinal, assigning him the title of San Gaetano.

164,Pietro Parolin,"Cardinal Pietro Parolin was born in Schiavon, in the province and Diocese of Vicenza in Northern Italy, to a hardware-store manager and an elementary school teacher, both practicing Catholics. When Pietro was only ten years old, his father was killed in an automobile accident, and it destabilized him for a time. He sensed a call to the priesthood at a very early age and entered the seminary in Vicenza when he was fourteen. After his ordination to the priesthood in 1980, at the age of twenty-five, his superiors sent him to study canon law at the Gregorian University in Rome. During that time, he began training for the Vatican’s diplomatic service. Having completed a thesis on the Synod of Bishops, he began his formal work as a diplomat in 1986. After a three-year stint in Nigeria, he worked in the nunciature of Mexico and there helped to reestablish diplomatic ties between that country and the Holy See. In 1992, he was recalled to Rome and there began to work in the “Second Section” of the Secretariat of State under Cardinal Angelo Sodano, then Vatican secretary of state. Parolin was placed in charge of diplomatic relations for Spain, Andorra, Italy, and San Marino. In 2000 he worked with the then Bishop Attilio Nicora on the matters pertaining to the implementation of the revision of the Lateran Concordat of 1984. Fluent in Italian, French, and Spanish, he is also proficient in English. From 2002 to 2009, Parolin was undersecretary of state for Relations with States, an influential yet low-key position, in which he directed relations with Vietnam, North Korea, Israel, and China. In 2009, he was ordained a bishop by Benedict XVI and nominated nuncio to Caracas, Venezuela. Pope Francis appointed Parolin secretary of state in 2013 and, in 2014, appointed him to his inner “Council of Cardinals,” who advise him on Church reform. Pietro Parolin has long been highly regarded by secular diplomats as a reliable and trusted papal representative on the world stage, someone who seems to be on a similar papal trajectory to that of former diplomat Pope St. Paul VI. A protégé of the late Cardinal Achille Silvestrini, also a papal nuncio and a leading member of the Saint Gallen Group which tried to thwart Pope Benedict XVI’s election in 2005, between 2002 and 2009 then-Msgr. Parolin used his diplomatic skills and ever-growing network of contacts in a wide variety of areas, notably nuclear disarmament, outreach to communist countries, and even mediation activities. He is especially expert in matters concerning the Middle East and the geo-political situation of the Asian continent. He played a crucial role in reestablishing direct contact between the Holy See and Beijing in 2005 — a lauded achievement at the time but a diplomatic overture that could prove to be his Achilles’ heel. His single-minded approach to Sino-Vatican relations culminated in 2018 in a controversial secret provisional agreement on the appointment of bishops, renewed in 2020, 2022, and 2024. The agreement has attracted widespread criticism, not only from Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun, bishop emeritus of Hong Kong, and ordinary Chinese Catholics pledging loyalty to Rome, but also from prominent Catholics in Europe and the United States who accused the Church of selling out to Communist China at the worst time, and with devastating consequences. Undeterred, Parolin has called for patience and typically avoided succumbing to public rancor over the issue. Cardinal Parolin drew similar criticisms when he played a significant role in negotiating with Spain’s leftist government the “resignifying” of a Franco memorial to the Spanish Civil War. While some appreciated his diplomatic approach to preserving religious elements at the site, others felt he had not done enough to resist secularization efforts or defend the Church’s association with the monument. In 2016-2017, he was attacked for his handling of another crisis, this time at the Order of Malta and the forced resignation of its Grand Master, Fra’ Matthew Festing. Parolin’s management of certain aspects of Vatican finances have also been questioned — namely, his roles in hindering, or at least failing to promote, financial reform, and his opaque involvement in a London property scandal for which he was never indicted but which led to prison sentences for some of his collaborators in the Secretariat of State. During the Covid emergency, the cardinal was keen to ensure what the Vatican deemed to be a compassionate global response while enforcing one of the world’s most stringent vaccine mandates in the Vatican. Questions persist over his position on contraception. He has also emerged as an ardent opponent of the traditional liturgy, seeing it as contrary to a “new paradigm” for the Church, one that is decentralized, more global, and synodal. He sees Pope Francis as implementing the teachings of the Council more fully. Cardinal Parolin has also had friendly connections with Italian Freemasonry dating back to 2002, according to the testimony of former grand master of the Grand Orient of Italy, Giuliano Di Bernardo. In 2019, Di Bernardo testified that he helped Cardinal Parolin “resolve a problem with the Chinese government” a few years before. Three years earlier, he said publicly that Parolin “does not have a negative and hostile attitude” to Freemasonry. In an interview shortly before the 2025 Conclave, De Bernardo said that at that first meeting with Parolin, there was “an immediate understanding and complete elective affinity; in fact, we collaborated on several projects. We’ve remained very good friends.” He added that he hoped Parolin would be elected pope. “If there’s a glimmer of rationality left in the Church, Parolin must be elected,” he said. “In that way, the Church can still have hope of rising again. But it’s not guaranteed.” To his critics, Cardinal Parolin is a modernist progressive with a globalist vision, a pragmatist who will place ideology and diplomatic solutions above hard truths of the faith. They also consider Parolin to be a master of the discredited Ostpolitik brand of diplomacy of the 1960s, especially when dealing with China. To his supporters, Cardinal Parolin is a courageous idealist, an avid proponent of peace, and a master of discretion and arbitration who wants no more than to carve out a new future for the Church in the twenty-first century. Still relatively young, he suffered a serious health scare in 2014 but is understood to have fully recovered. Parolin is one of the few senior curial officials who can boast of having remained in his position for almost the entirety of this pontificate. His relationship with Francis has had its ups and downs, but the Pope has often expressed his appreciation for him and he has remained a trusted member of his Council of Cardinals since 2014. A significant mark against Parolin is his lack of pastoral experience. While his faith was nurtured in his local parish as a young man, and he served as an altar boy, his priestly career has been dedicated to Vatican diplomacy and administration rather than parish ministry. As someone who wishes to be close to the poor and with an ecclesial and political outlook similar to Francis, he is seen as a natural successor to the current pope if cardinal electors wanted a continuity figure, someone expected to pursue many, if not all, of Francis’ radical reforms but in a quieter, subtler, and more diplomatic manner.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Parolin embodies a modernist progressive theology that emphasizes a globalist vision and a decentralized, synodal Church in line with Pope Francis' reforms.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his discretion and diplomatic finesse, often employing patience and a collaborative approach in complex negotiations.  
• Power Base: Parolin's extensive experience in Vatican diplomacy and his connections with secular diplomats provide him with a robust network of support within both ecclesiastical and political spheres.

He assumed full leadership of the Archdiocese on July 22, 1992, following the resignation of Cardinal Laurean Rugambwa. A significant milestone in Pengo’s career came on February 21, 1998, when Pope John Paul II elevated him to the rank of cardinal, assigning him the title of Nostra Signora de La Salette. As a Cardinal, Pengo participated in the conclaves that elected Pope Benedict XVI in 2005 and Pope Francis in 2013. Throughout his tenure, Cardinal Pengo has held several important positions within the Church. He served as President of the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar (SECAM) from 2007 to 2009 and was a member of various Vatican congregations and councils. In November 2018, he spoke of his strong opposition to ideological colonization, urging the Tanzanian government to reject in particular any foreign aid that is conditioned on accepting Western cultural norms regarding homosexuality. He said all Tanzanians should say no to homosexuality, which he claimed was “encroaching very fast in African countries.” After serving as Archbishop of Dar-es-Salaam for 27 years, Pope Francis accepted Cardinal Pengo’s retirement on August 15, 2019, at the age of 75.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Pengo advocates for a traditional Catholic doctrine, emphasizing moral theology and opposition to ideological colonization, particularly regarding Western cultural norms on sexuality.

166,Giuseppe Petrocchi,"Cardinal Giuseppe Petrocchi is a former Archbishop of L’Aquila who has been dedicated to tending to his flock after a devastating earthquake in 2009. In 2020 Pope Francis appointed him the head of a study commission on a possible female diaconate. Born on August 19, 1948, in Ascoli Piceno, Italy, he entered the Episcopal Seminary of Ascoli Piceno in 1965 and was ordained a priest on September 14, 1973. Petrocchi pursued higher education, obtaining a degree in philosophy from the University of Macerata and a degree in psychology from La Sapienza University in Rome. Throughout his ecclesiastical life, Petrocchi held various positions within the Church. He served as a parish priest and taught religion in state schools. He also edited a diocesan newspaper and served for three years as a psychologist at a family counseling center in the diocese. In 1998, he was appointed Bishop of Latina-Terracina-Sezze-Priverno, where he served until 2013. On May 8, 2013, Pope Francis appointed him as the Archbishop of L’Aquila, a position he held until 2024. In June 2018, Pope Francis elevated him to the cardinalate in recognition for his dedication and service to the Church, particularly in areas suffering from natural disaster. Two years later, the Pope appointed Petrocchi to head a new commission — requested at the Synod on the Amazon — to study the possibility of women deacons. A previous commission had been composed in August 2016, shortly after the International Union of Superiors General had asked the Pope to think about it in an audience they had with him in May 2016. That commission handed in their research, which the Pope said was inconclusive. As Archbishop of L’Aquila, Petrocchi faced the challenging task of leading an archdiocese still recovering from the devastating earthquake of 2009. He was credited with revitalizing the Church’s pastoral outreach and resolving economic problems within the local curia. His leadership during this difficult period was marked by compassion and a focus on rebuilding both the physical and spiritual aspects of the community. Petrocchi’s work in earthquake-affected areas has been particularly noteworthy. He has been deeply engaged in regions that suffered heartbreaking losses during earthquakes in Italy between 2009 and 2016, which claimed more than 600 lives. His efforts to provide support and guidance to these communities have been widely recognized. Cardinal Petrocchi seems to attribute great importance to the Eucharist in Christian life, underlining the central role of this sacrament in the Catholic faith. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the cardinal celebrated Masses broadcast on TV and live-streamed, demonstrating attention to the need to make the liturgy accessible even in exceptional circumstances. Petrocchi has also regularly celebrated Masses on significant occasions, such poignant anniversaries of the L’Aquila earthquake. The cardinal has emphasized the community aspect of the liturgy and the Eucharist, and has spoken about a “spirituality of communion” and the maturation of a “diocesan conscience.”  Petrocchi tends to connect the liturgy and the Eucharist to the concrete lives of the faithful. The cardinal seems to give importance to the liturgical formation of the faithful. During his episcopate in Latina, he promoted initiatives such as the “basic course for pastoral animators” and introduced a six-year course for preparation for the Sacraments of Christian initiation. Cardinal Petrocchi was often involved in the Celestinian Forgiveness (Perdonanza Celestiniana), an annual celebration deeply rooted in the cultural identity of L’Aquila. Established in 1294 by papal bull by Pope Celestine V who abdicated the papacy, a plenary indulgence (remission of sins) is granted to all pilgrims who visit the Basilica of Santa Maria di Collemaggio in L’Aquila on August 28 and 29 each year. Pope Francis visited L’Aquila for this event in 2022, and Petrocchi noted that it was the first time in 728 years that a pope had opened the holy door for this celebration.1 Cardinal Petrocchi has chosen not to comment on many pressing contemporary problems in the Church and the world, preferring to focus on local pastoral care, rebuilding efforts, and spiritual leadership, particularly in the face of natural disasters affecting his archdiocese.","• Theology/Ideology: Petrocchi emphasizes the central role of the Eucharist and promotes a “spirituality of communion” that connects liturgical practices to the lives of the faithful.

During the 1970s, Piacenza simultaneously exercised a number of roles: from 1970 to 1975, he was parochial vicar; from 1973 to 1978, he was a spiritual director in the seminary; and from 1975 to 1976, he studied at the Lateran University in Rome, earning a license in canon law summa cum laude. Similarly, from 1970 to 1990, he was a judge for the diocesan tribunal. From 1978 to 1990, he taught canon law at a university, and also taught in his alma mater secondary school, Cristoforo Colombo. During this period, he offered weekly catechetical programs on the local television network and was an official visitator for many religious communities, while preaching numerous spiritual exercises for clergy, seminarians, male and female religious, and laity. His numerous writings have focused on spiritual formation, especially for clergy. In 1990, Piacenza was called to Rome to serve as an official at the Congregation for the Clergy. He was appointed Secretary in 2000, and in 2003, Pope John Paul II appointed Piacenza to be president of the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church (Beni Culturali). In the same year, Piacenza was consecrated bishop by Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone (then archbishop of Genoa), with Cardinal Darío Castrillón Hoyos, then prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy and president of the Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei, as a co-consecrator. In 2004, John Paul appointed Piacenza president of the Pontifical Commission for Sacred Archaeology. Benedict XVI selected Piacenza to lead the Congregation for the Clergy in 2010 and, in the same year, elevated him to the cardinalate. Since 2011, Cardinal Piacenza has served as president of Aid to the Church in Need, a pontifical foundation that helps persecuted Christians. In 2013, Pope Francis replaced him as prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy with the diplomat Cardinal Beniamino Stella, previously nuncio in Cuba and Colombia, and promoted Piacenza to major penitentiary, the head of the Apostolic Penitentiary, the Church’s highest tribunal responsible for issues related to the forgiveness of sins. Keeping the salvation of souls in mind above all, Mauro Piacenza has extensive experience as a teacher and spiritual guide. His devotion to the Eucharist and the Blessed Virgin Mary has helped in a particular way in his work for priests in the Congregation for the Clergy, where he labored for more than twenty years, eventually becoming prefect. He was an obvious choice to lead the congregation, being what some might call “a priest’s priest,” someone sought after to give retreats who works effectively and discreetly also when it comes to defending orthodoxy against errors within the Church. His work in Genoa and then in Rome in caring for the cultural treasures of the Church is a manifestation of his commitment to maintain Catholic traditions and make them accessible to new generations. He holds fast to all doctrines of the Church on moral matters, clearly stating magisterial teachings on issues such as abortion, surrogate motherhood, and the need to evangelize non-Christian cultures. For him, there is no question that the priesthood in the Latin Church should remain for celibate males alone, with no room for “homosexual culture” in the seminary or rectory, or for women’s ordination. He discreetly battles revolutionary ideas while affirming right principles and has a reputation for being a good judge of character, placing faithful people in the right posts. Correcting a false sense of mercy, Cardinal Piacenza has frequently recalled the beauty and efficacy of the sacrament of Confession as a remedy for many evils faced by individuals today. The gospel is for migrants as well, he says, such that all care for refugees must include a spiritual component to ensure that they have the opportunity to meet Christ when they also seek material welfare. He also has a special concern for the persecuted. A man of great discretion, Cardinal Piacenza has proven experience in academia, administration, and pastoral work. He shows piety and reverence in worship, handles difficult situations with sensitivity, and possesses a detailed knowledge of, and respect for, religious vocations. Given his proven administrative abilities and profound spiritual sensibilities, Cardinal Piacenza has shown himself to have qualities that would surely suit a pastor not only in Italy but in a broader capacity. Cardinal Mauro Piacenza retired as the Major Penitentiary of the Apostolic Penitentiary on April 6, 2024, at the age of 79.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Piacenza upholds traditional Catholic doctrines, emphasizing the necessity of celibacy for priests and the rejection of women's ordination.

169,Maurice Piat,"Cardinal Maurice Piat is a retired Mauritian bishop known for his dedication to pastoral work and his efforts in promoting basic ecclesial communities. Born on July 19, 1941, in Moka, Mauritius as the youngest son of Maurice Piat and Alix Koenig, he grew up in the diocese of Port-Louis. He completed his secondary education at the Collège du Saint-Esprit in Quatre-Bornes, Mauritius. Following his early education, Piat entered the novitiate of the Congregation of the Holy Spirit in Ireland, where he made his religious profession on September 8, 1962. He then pursued higher education, obtaining a Bachelor’s degree from University College, Dublin. Continuing his theological studies, Piat attended the Pontifical French Seminary in Rome and the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he earned a licentiate in theology in 1972. Piat was ordained priest on August 2, 1970. After his ordination, he briefly ministered in Bangalore, India, before returning to Mauritius. Back in his homeland, he took on various roles, including professor and catechist at the Collège du Saint-Esprit, and was responsible for aspiring seminarians at the Foyer Monseigneur-Murphy in Vacoas. His ecclesiastical career progressed rapidly. On January 21, 1991, Piat was appointed coadjutor of the then-bishop of Port-Louis, Cardinal Jean Margéot, and received episcopal consecration on May 19 of the same year. He became the Bishop of Port Louis on March 13, 1993, a position he held until his retirement on May 19, 2023. Throughout his tenure, Piat has held several significant positions within the Catholic Church hierarchy. He served as president of the Episcopal Conference of the Indian Ocean multiple times and has been a member of the Standing Committee of the Symposium of the Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar (SECAM) since 2000. In recognition of his service and leadership, Pope Francis created and proclaimed Piat as Cardinal in the consistory of November 19, 2016, assigning him the titular church of Santa Teresa al Corso d’Italia. Cardinal Piat’s influence extends beyond his home country. He has participated in important Church events, such as the XIV Ordinary General Assembly of the Synod of Bishops in October 2015, which focused on the vocation and mission of the family in the Church and contemporary world. Known for his dedication to pastoral work and his efforts in promoting basic ecclesial communities, Cardinal Maurice Piat has left an indelible mark on the Catholic Church in Mauritius and beyond, serving as a spiritual leader and guide for many faithful throughout his long and distinguished career.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Maurice Piat emphasizes pastoral work and the promotion of basic ecclesial communities, reflecting a commitment to grassroots engagement within the Church.

170,Christophe Pierre,"Cardinal Christophe Louis Yves Georges Pierre, the apostolic nuncio to the United States, is an accomplished veteran Vatican diplomat who has had to deal — not always successfully — with tense relations between the American episcopate and the Francis pontificate. Born on January 30, 1946 in Rennes, France, Pierre completed his primary education in Madagascar and secondary schooling in France and Morocco before entering the seminary. After military service, he was ordained a priest for the diocese of Rennes, in the cathedral of Saint-Malo, on 5 April 1970. Pierre then pursued higher education, obtaining a Master's in Sacred Theology from the Catholic Institute of Paris, and a Doctorate in Canon Law in Rome. After completing further studies at the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, the Holy See's training school for diplomats in Rome, Pierre's diplomatic career with the Holy See began in 1977, taking him to various postings around the world including New Zealand, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Cuba, and Brazil. From 1991 to 1995, he was the Holy See's Permanent Observer to the United Nations in Geneva. In 1995 Pope John Paul II named him apostolic nuncio to Haiti. He went on to serve as nuncio to Uganda from 1999 to 2007 and to Mexico from 2007 to 2016. In 2016, Pope Francis appointed Pierre Apostolic Nuncio to the United States, succeeding Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò who had retired on age grounds. In September 2023, Pope Francis elevated Pierre to the rank of cardinal – an unusual step as most apostolic nuncios to the U.S. are given the red hat after they leave the office. It is also rare, at least until Francis' pontificate, for an active papal diplomat to be made a cardinal. Cardinal Pierre has been described as a diplomat who aims to quell conflicts and promote harmony within the Church and he has had occasional successes in bridging divides and promote unity among Catholics. This was particularly apparent during his posting in Mexico where he was credited with overcoming political divisions. On the Eucharist, Cardinal Pierre strongly supported the recent National Eucharistic Revival in the United States. He said he saw it as a way to 'renew the Church' and believes the revival should lead to conversion of heart, commitment to evangelization, service, and community. Pierre emphasized the importance of believing in Christ's Real Presence in the Eucharist, stressing it is a source of unity for the Church, but also saying it means recognizing Christ 'in the assembly of His believing people' and even in those struggling to connect with Him. Pierre connects the Eucharistic revival with the concept of synodality promoted by Pope Francis, and he has encouraged U.S. bishops to embrace synodality as 'the path forward for the Church.' He sees both the Eucharist and synodality as interrelated paths for the Church's renewal and evangelization efforts. The French Vatican diplomat has affirmed that the Church 'must be unapologetically pro-life' and that the she cannot abandon its defence of innocent human life. He advocates a 'synodal approach' to abortion, stressing the need to listen and understand rather than simply condemn. Pierre's tenure in the U.S. has not been without problems. He faced several challenges, including mediating tensions between American bishops and the Vatican on issues such as the McCarrick scandal, the COVID-19 pandemic response, and disagreements over liturgical and doctrinal matters. And although he found some common ground with bishops on immigration (Pierre has been a strong advocate for immigrants and participated in demonstrations with border bishops against building walls on the border with Mexico), he has also faced several criticisms. These include his handling of episcopal misconduct cases related to clerical sex abuse in the U.S. and his reported reluctance to engage with the press on such matters. Other critics have said he has shown some misunderstanding of the U.S. Church, and have asserted that he has isolated himself from U.S. bishops, leading to diminishing support for him in the episcopate. Traditional Catholics have criticized Pierre for his strident views against the traditional liturgy and for reportedly pressuring diocesan bishops to cancel thriving Latin Masses in the United States. He has spoken negatively of young priests who 'dream about wearing cassocks and celebrating Mass in the pre-Vatican II way.' He sees this as potentially problematic, and as a response to feeling lost in modern society. Meanwhile, critics on the progressive wing of the Church have noted his struggle to help U.S. bishops connect with Pope Francis's vision, particularly regarding synodality. They also contend that he is regularly at odds with progressive U.S. cardinals such as Blase Cupich and Robert McElroy who have direct lines to the Pope. For his part, Pierre has been critical of the conservative Catholic press, but reportedly unwilling to consider reasons for their criticisms of Pope Francis. Regarding his role in helping to appoint bishops, Cardinal Pierre has been credited for helping a number of conservative-leaning priests to be elevated to the U.S. episcopate. Cardinal Pierre is known for his linguistic abilities, and speaks French, English, Italian, Spanish, and Portuguese fluently.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Pierre strongly supports the Eucharistic Revival and emphasizes the importance of Christ's Real Presence in fostering unity within the Church.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is recognized as a skilled diplomat who seeks to promote harmony and bridge divides, though he has faced challenges in maintaining relationships with U.S. bishops.  
• Power Base: Pierre has established a network through his diplomatic career and has been influential in the appointment of conservative-leaning bishops in the U.S. episcopate.

171,Pierbattista Pizzaballa,"To understand Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa’s personality, one needs to begin in the countryside of his native Lombardy in Northern Italy. Shaped as a child by the “simple and authentic world” of Castel Liteggio, a hamlet of Cologno al Serio, the future Patriarch of Jerusalem was born the youngest of three brothers, to Pietro Pizzaballa and Maria Maddalena Tadini, in 1965. As he would recall at his episcopal ordination in September 2016, he enjoyed a simple, rural and happy childhood. “Those were the last years of a simple country life, with the farmsteads already beginning to depopulate, but still living the last moments of a world now gone by,” he said. “The visits to the stables, where I was sent to fetch milk, the joy of riding in the horse-drawn carts to go make hay, the simple country games, and so on. It was a simple and genuine world, and a sober and happy life. Only with time did I realize how that world would influence me by giving me a style and pursuit of sobriety and sincerity” that would find fulfillment in the Franciscan life. “At the age of nine he already knew he wanted to be a priest,” his mother recalled. “He was really convinced, he felt his vocation very early, while I was initially against it, I didn’t want him to go to the seminary. In the end, however, he was so insistent that I had to reconsider, and I enrolled him in [minor seminary], in Bologna. I must say in retrospect that it was a very wise choice, the right path for my son.” Pizzaballa was especially drawn to the figure of a much-loved local priest, Don Pèrsec, who came from the village on his bicycle. “How they waited for him, how they loved him! And how he loved those people,” Pizzaballa said. “I left home early, but those years I remember them well and they were instrumental in putting a face to my first vocation. I wanted to be like Fr Pèrsec.” At the age of eleven, he entered the Le Grazie minor seminary in Rimini, run by the Franciscans, and there discovered the missions. However, at the time his dream was not to travel to the Holy Land but China. “I was in the minor seminary and there were several old missionaries there who were expelled from the country after Mao Tze Tung took power in 1949,” he explained. “Those missionaries often talked about their experience. And I used to say as a child: ‘I want to become a missionary and go and do what they did.’” Pizzaballa completed seminary training in Ferrara in 1984 and entered the Order of Friars Minor on September 5 of that year. The first stages of his religious life led him to La Verna, where he completed the novitiate and, in September 1985, professed temporary vows. He then went to Bologna, and professed solemn vows on October 10, 1989, in the Church of Sant’Antonio. He was ordained to the priesthood on September 15, 1990, by the Archbishop of Bologna at the time, Cardinal Giacomo Biffi. One month later, his Provincial sent the 25-year-old priest to study at the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum in Jerusalem, where he obtained a license in Biblical Theology. “I went there somewhat recalcitrantly but obediently,” Pizzaballa confessed, having hoped to go to Rome for biblical studies. When he arrived first in Jerusalem on October 7, 1990, at the age of 25, he spoke “only Italian and the native dialect of Bergamo.” Reflecting on those first days in the Holy Land, he recalled: “It was still the first Intifada. I arrived the evening of the seventh, and the day after, on the eighth, right where I was in the Muslim quarter, on the Esplanade of Mosques, there was a clash between Israeli military and Palestinians which resulted in twenty two deaths … so it was a particular way to begin my time there.” Describing those initial days as both a “cultural shock,” and a “spiritual desert,” he said: “It was difficult for me to understand why I was there: I didn’t speak the languages. I didn’t understand all the violence, which for me was very foreign. Then, we were on the eve of the Gulf War, so there were curfews everywhere. It wasn’t simple, but it was salutary, in the sense that it forced me to find the deep and real reasons for my vocation, and for my obedience.” Recognizing his love for the Old Testament, his new provincial then sent him to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1995-1999) and in 1998 he became assistant professor of Biblical Hebrew and Judaism at the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum and the Studium Theologicum Jerosolymitanum. Pizzaballa was the only Christian studying Scripture at the Hebrew University at that time but said it was “very interesting” because it was the first time that he found himself in a “non-Christian context.” Having formed friendships with his Jewish classmates, he said: “They began to ask me questions about my faith, about my vocation, why I was there, and then little by little we talked about the Gospel, the New Testament, and we would read it together. It was a beautiful experience. For me, this is what true interreligious dialogue is, because the questions of these Jews, who didn’t know about Jesus, were not my own. I come from the ‘Bassa Bergamasca’ where … you’re Christian before you are born, so you knew everything about Jesus. While their questions, for instance, on the Resurrection … were never put to me in that way. It was very beautiful.” The cardinal now also speaks and preaches in English. As for modern Hebrew, he learned it so well — ‘fluently,’ says the Israeli website Ynet — that within five years of his arrival he collaborated in editing the Roman Missal in Hebrew and translated various liturgical texts. On July 2, 1999, after nine years in Jerusalem, he formally entered into service with the Custody of the Holy Land, the Franciscan province in the Middle East. During these years, he also served as vicar general of the then-Patriarch for Hebrew-speaking Catholics, Michel Sabbah. From 2001 he served as superior of the Monastery of Saints Simeon and Anne in Jerusalem. During this time, he daily welcomed pilgrims who impressed him with their “desire to learn more about the Bible and the Gospels.” In May 2004, at the age of just 39, Pizzaballa was appointed the 167th Custos of the Holy Land, an important leadership post he would hold for twelve years.1 Recalling his decision to say ‘yes’ to the appointment, he said: “I thought for a long time whether to say yes or no. Obedience is not just adhering to what the superiors command. If the community chooses you so clearly and voluntarily, honestly, if you have no serious reasons to say no, there is no point in refusing. You have to accept in the spirit of service.” Taking stock of his first two years as Custos, in 2006 he said his priorities would include “interaction with the Jewish world,” seeing that, “traditionally, the Custody has always been close to the Arab world.”2 The approach was a wise one that helped establish himself as a trusted broker between the two embattled peoples. On the level of “operational choices,” one of the first decisions he made was for “young religious in formation to study at least one of the three languages spoken in our context (Arabic, Hebrew and Greek),” he noted, so as to integrate into the “Israeli context”. At the same time, he noted that the new assignment also implied more frequent interaction with other Churches: “The way of contact and dialogue in the East is very different than with us [in the West]. Religious authorities have their own role, and you need to stay in it. If you don’t stay in it, you scandalize [others] and are not understood.” Reflecting on the human consequences of becoming Custos, he said: “Everything has changed. Before I had a simpler lifestyle: with a lot of time for prayer, work, research. Now, to begin with, I have no privacy. … My office then involves a lot of loneliness. It is inevitable: if you want to keep yourself free, especially in such a small setting, you also have to be alone. Finally, you realize—and perhaps it is human—that when you have responsibilities the interpersonal relationships you already had change. You often suffer, and sometimes you are also forced to disappoint people you love or hold in esteem. You have to take that into account.” In 2008, Pizzaballa was appointed as a consultant to the Pontifical Council for Christian Unity in the commission for relations with Judaism. In October 2010, he participated in the Synod of Bishops on the Middle East.3 And in 2014 he played a key role in organizing the meeting in the Vatican Gardens between Pope Francis, Israeli President Shimon Peres, Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas, and the Patriarch of Constantinople. Pizzaballa’s long tenure as Custos ended on May 20, 2016 (after an initial appointment of six years he was given two successive confirmations of three years each), when he passed the baton to Father Francis Patton. One month later, Pope Francis accepted the resignation of 76-year-old Jordanian Patriarch Fouad Twal. Rather than appointing a successor, he named Pizzaballa apostolic administrator sede vacante of the Patriarchate, conferring on him archiepiscopal dignity and assigning him the titular see of Verbe. Pizzaballa assumed his office on July 15, 2016, and was ordained to the episcopate on September 15 of that year in the Cathedral of Bergamo.4 Asked why took the motto Sufficit tibi gratia mea, Pizzaballa said the appointment was unexpected because the patriarchs for the past 40 years have been Arab. “I wasn’t very prepared and I knew that difficulties awaited me and to be honest, I didn’t feel I was up to it,” he said, adding that he trusted in the grace of God.5 He added, however, that “grace always comes with the cross.” Pope Francis’ decision to name a transitional apostolic administrator was aimed, at least in part, at remedying a period of administrative and crises in the Patriarchate. The “Pizzaballa administration” was successful, and on October 24, 2020, he was appointed Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem. At the same time, he also became president of the Assembly of Catholic Ordinaries of the Holy Land, a role that de jure falls to the Latin Patriarch of the region. Three years later, on July 9, 2023, Pope Francis included Pizzaballa’s name among the new cardinals he would create on September 30 of that year. Pierbattista Pizzaballa thus became the first Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem to raised to the cardinalate6 and the first cardinal to reside in the State of Israel. On October 7, 2023, just one week after the consistory, the conflict between Israel and Hamas erupted, following an attack in Israel by Hamas militiamen from Gaza. Two weeks later, the Patriarch called for a day of prayer and fasting for peace, just after having said he was ready to offer himself as a hostage in exchange for the release of the children who had fallen into the hands of Hamas terrorists. A few days later, the Patriarch issued an appeal to “stop this war, this senseless violence,” stating “with clarity that what happened on October 7 in southern Israel, is in no way admissible and we cannot but condemn it” while stating “with equal clarity today that this new cycle of violence has brought to Gaza over five thousand deaths, including many women and children.” Cardinal Pizzaballa took possession of his titular church of Sant’Onofrio on May 1, 2024, two weeks later than scheduled due to the hostilities. Later that month, after long months of negotiations with authorities, he was able to personally enter Gaza, celebrating Mass in the Catholic parish of the Holy Family and visiting the Orthodox parish. The Patriarchate carries out a joint humanitarian mission with the Order of Malta to provide food and medical assistance to the population of Gaza. The timing of his elevation to the cardinalate and the conflict that exploded shortly thereafter have inevitably increased the world’s attention on the cardinal from Bergamo, who since the years of his tenure as Custos of the Holy Land has operated in an area as significant for the history of salvation as it is complex and plagued by perennial tensions. Cardinal Pizzaballa’s Approaches Little is known about Cardinal Pizzaballa’s theology or doctrinal positions partly because he rarely addresses controversial issues. But from what we do know of his words and actions, it is possible to discern a desire to abide by the orthodox traditions and practices of the Church while also remaining open to modernity. He strongly believes in the centrality of Christ in the Eucharist, has a fervent Marian devotion, and is a great believer in the path of sanctification through tribulation in that great crucible of suffering that is the Middle East. The Latin Patriarch appears to care deeply for his flock as was vividly seen during the Hamas-Israel war. His long experience of the Holy Land means he is able to engage both sides in this seemingly intractable conflict. Unafraid to speak out, he has striven to treat Arabs and Israelis with equanimity, but with arguably more sympathy for the Palestinian people whom he sees as “still waiting for their rights, their dignity or recognition.” The cardinal patriarch is aware of the current problems in the Church and recognizes this period of history as one of “great disorientation and confusion” but does not want to go back to a bygone era. Cardinals are no longer seen as Princes of the Church, he has said echoing Francis’ sentiment, but rather “its servants and those of the people of God.” He has a passion for Holy Scripture from which he draws life and sustenance, and wants to see his clergy receive the best formation so they “know how to interpret the concrete reality.” Pierbattista Pizzaballa has a number of similarities with Pope Francis. He has a disdain for clericalism and a concern for migrants, interreligious dialogue and, to some extent, the environment. But he also has some important yet subtle differences. Like Francis, he wants the Church to be open to everyone but he believes “this doesn’t mean that it belongs to everyone.” He stresses the importance of social justice, rights and duties but underlines that the “starting point has to be the faith.” And he is a firm believer that changes in the Church are nothing to fear because it is not man who makes the Church “but Christ [who] leads it.” He is also not closed off to parts of the Church that are growing. Liberal in the classical sense, he sees the old rite as one among the many diverse rites in the Church and so allows it. Liturgically, he appears to lean towards tradition, always favoring the centrality of the Eucharist, although he reportedly restricted the Traditional Latin Mass after Traditionis Custodes. He recoiled at having to close churches during Covid. Possessing the frankness, decisiveness and discernment of a Lombard farmer combined with a deep Franciscan spirituality, Cardinal Pizzaballa brings a wealth of experience and connections from the Holy Land that is crucial for the Church and for world peace. But he remains relatively young, little is known about his theology and views on key issues, and he has only been a cardinal for a short time. These factors may preclude him from being considered a serious papabile in the short term, but he looks destined to be a leading cardinal candidate in the years ahead.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Pizzaballa embodies a blend of traditional Catholic orthodoxy with a modern openness to interreligious dialogue and social justice.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is characterized by his frankness, decisiveness, and a deep Franciscan spirituality, which enable him to engage effectively in complex negotiations.  
• Power Base: His long-standing role as Custos of the Holy Land has established him as a trusted intermediary between diverse communities, particularly Jews and Palestinians.

172,Mario Aurelio Poli,"Cardinal Mario Aurelio Poli is a retired Archbishop of Buenos Aires who succeeded Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio as the city’s archbishop when Francis was elected pope in 2013. He has a similar pastoral approach to Francis and to be a promoter of interfaith dialogue. Born on November 29, 1947, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, Mario Poli completed his primary education in a state school, and secondary education in the parish school of San Pedro Apóstol. He attended the faculty of law and social sciences at the University of Buenos Aires, where he obtained the title of Licenziado en Servicio Social. At the age of 22, he entered the metropolitan seminary of Buenos Aires where he took courses in philosophy and theology and was ordained a priest on 25 November 1978, and was incardinated in Buenos Aires. He holds a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina. Poli was ordained as a priest on November 25, 1978, at the age of 30, serving in the Archdiocese of Buenos Aires. Since 1980 he has taught ecclesiastical history at the faculty of theology at the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina. He also held many other positions including chaplain, director of institutional vocations, and a member of a college of consultors and presbyteral council. In 1992, the then-Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Cardinal Antonio Quarracino, appointed Poli director of the San José Vocational Institute, where seminarians from the archdiocese of Buenos Aires begin their priestly formation. He was carrying out that vital task when Pope John Paul II appointed him Auxiliary Bishop of Buenos Aires on February 8, 2002, at the age of 54. He was consecrated a bishop in April 2002. His career progressed with his appointment as Bishop of Santa Rosa, Argentina, in 2008. On March 28, 2013, Pope Francis appointed him his successor as Archbishop of Buenos Aires, and he was installed a month later. In May of that year, Francis also appointed him Bishop for the Faithful of the Eastern Rites in Argentina — those who belong to the Catholic Eastern rites in Argentina but are without an Ordinary. He has served as the first vice-president of the Episcopal Conference of Argentina, and been a member of the Episcopal Commission for Catholic Education and of the Episcopal Commission for Biblical Catechetical and Pastoral Care. Pope Francis elevated Mario Aurelio Poli to the rank of Cardinal in February 2014. Cardinal Poli retired as Archbishop of Buenos Aires, and as Bishop for the Faithful of the Eastern Rites, on May 26, 2023, at the age of 75. One of the most notable aspects of Cardinal Poli’s career was his succession of Pope Francis as Archbishop of Buenos Aires. The appointment highlighted the trust and confidence placed in him by the newly elected pontiff. Cardinal Poli considers the Eucharist to be a fundamental element in the lives of believers. He views the Eucharist as a central element of the Catholic faith, with the power to transform lives, inspire mission, and unite the community of believers. His view of the Eucharist and liturgy appears to be deeply rooted in Catholic tradition, emphasizing their importance both for individual spiritual life and for the collective mission of the Church. Poli opposed same sex “marriage” in Argentina and in 2013 said that he would have a respectful but distant relationship with the administration of Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner — a political stance similar to that of Bergoglio. He also called for increased dialogue between the Church and the state. His pastoral approach is similar to Francis, but by his own admission he steers clear of politics unless he believes he has a prophetic message he feels called to share. “I am a pastor and not a politician. I am not like Bergoglio in that,” he said in 2014, adding that he has a “different temperament.” As the Archbishop of Buenos Aires, Cardinal Poli would likely have been significantly involved in the creation of a directive on Amoris Laetitia and its controversial teaching on Communion for divorced and civilly remarried. Pope Francis strongly endorsed the guidelines, stating that they “completely explain the meaning of Chapter VIII of Amoris Laetitia” and that there were “no other interpretations.” The cardinal has otherwise said little publicly about core moral teachings, the liturgy, or controversies. In 2014, he said he was “bit shy of the press” and therefore reluctant to give interviews.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Poli emphasizes the centrality of the Eucharist in Catholic life and promotes interfaith dialogue while maintaining traditional Catholic teachings.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He has a pastoral approach akin to Pope Francis but expresses a preference for avoiding political entanglements unless compelled by a prophetic message.  
• Power Base: As the former Archbishop of Buenos Aires and a member of various Episcopal commissions, he has a strong foundation within the Argentine Church and significant influence over local clergy.

173,Anthony Poola,"Cardinal Anthony Poola is an Indian prelate dedicated to helping children out of poverty and whose elevation to the College of Cardinals has been viewed as a step towards addressing the inequalities of the caste system in India. Born on November 15, 1961, in Chindukur, Durvesi Parish, in the Diocese of Kurnool, India, Poola is a member of the Dalit social group in India. The word Dalit is derived from Sanskrit and means “broken” or “downtrodden.” It is considered to be the lowest caste in the social hierarchy in India and although the caste system has been officially abolished, they have often been victims of discrimination, human rights, violations and violence. Poola overcame poverty in his youth with the help of missionaries who supported his education. “The took charge of me and helped me go to school and made me a worthwhile,” he said. “That is the reason why I want to join the seminary.” After attending St. Peter’s Pontifical Seminary in Bangalore, he was ordained a priest on February 20, 1992, for the Diocese of Cuddapah. Throughout his career, Cardinal Poola has held various positions within the Church. He served as a parish vicar, pastor, and director of the Christian Foundation for Children and the Aging. His educational pursuits led him to study health pastoral care and theology at Loyola University Chicago in the 2000s, and while there he worked at St. Genevieve Church in the Archdiocese of Chicago. He also took a course in CPE (Clinical Pastoral Education) at Bronson Methodist Hospital, Department of Pastoral Care and Education in Kalamazoo, U.S.A. A significant milestone in his career came on February 8, 2008, when Pope Benedict XVI appointed him Bishop of Kurnool, during which time he erected 11 new parishes. Pope Francis later appointed him Metropolitan Archbishop of Hyderabad, where he was installed on January 3, 2021. He was elevated to cardinal the following year, making him the first Dalit and the first Telugu — an ethno-linguistic group of people native to the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana — to attain the rank of cardinal. The appointment has been seen as a significant step towards recognizing and including marginalized communities within the Church hierarchy. As cardinal, Poola has expressed his mission to help as many poor children as possible, drawing from his own life experiences. He has been particularly active in supporting education for underprivileged children, often personally assisting in their placement in boarding schools. His stated vision is that “no child should be deprived of education because of poverty,” and he has been involved in giving scholarships to children of poor families. In addition to his pastoral duties, Cardinal Poola has shown a creative side, producing Telugu devotional audio cassettes, writes lyrics in Telugu, composes songs, and conducts choirs. Cardinal Poola’s focus has been social justice issues and there is little record of him commenting on other aspects of Catholic moral teaching or the sacraments. Rather, his appointment as the first Dalit cardinal has brought attention to the ongoing issues of caste discrimination in India. Despite the official abolition of the caste system, Poola has acknowledged that remnants of it still exist, and his elevation is seen as a step towards addressing these social inequalities. Cardinal Poola’s journey from a poor Dalit boy to a cardinal in the Catholic Church is seen as inspirational and symbolic of the Church’s efforts to embrace diversity and serve marginalized communities. His appointment has been celebrated by Dalit groups and seen as an honor for the deprived sections of society, particularly significant given that over sixty percent of Catholic Church followers in India are Dalit. The cardinal is known for his linguistic abilities, speaking Telugu, English, Hindi, Tamil, Kannada, and Italian. His fluency in Telugu is particularly significant, as it is a language spoken by more than 75 million people in India.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Poola emphasizes social justice and educational access, particularly for underprivileged children, reflecting his commitment to addressing caste inequalities.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his compassionate and approachable demeanor, which facilitates dialogue and collaboration with diverse communities.

175,Paul Poupard,"Cardinal Paul Joseph Jean Poupard is a distinguished former senior Vatican official and an acclaimed author on cultural affairs whose writings have been translated into multiple languages. Born on August 30, 1930, in Bouzillé, France, Poupard was ordained priest on December 18, 1954, and immediately began his career in teaching while continuing his studies and pastoral ministry. Poupard’s academic achievements include a doctorate in theology and history from the Sorbonne University, where he focused on the relationship between reason and faith, and between Church and State. His early career involved working at the national center of scientific research and serving as an official of the Secretary of State and Chaplain of the San Domenico Institute in Rome. Poupard was present at the opening of the Second Vatican Council and provided services to Popes John XXIII and Paul VI. He then spent a decade as Rector of the Catholic Institute of Paris before being elected titular Bishop of Usula and Auxiliary of the Archbishop of Paris on February 2, 1979. Poupard’s rise in the Church hierarchy continued when Pope John Paul II promoted him to Archbishop in 1980, appointing him as Pro-president of the Secretariat for Non-believers. He later became President of the Executive Committee of the newly created Pontifical Council for Culture in 1982. On May 27, 1985, St. John Paul II created and proclaimed Poupard as Cardinal, with the Title of S. Prassede (St. Praxedes). Throughout his career, Cardinal Poupard has held several significant positions within the Vatican. He served as President of the Pontifical Council for Culture for many years — from 1988 to 2007 — and briefly as President of the Pontifical Council for Inter-religious Dialogue in 2006.

176,Robert Francis Prevost,"Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, a former prefect of the influential Dicastery for Bishops, is a Chicago-born prelate with views close to Pope Francis who spent many years as a missionary in Peru before being elected head of the Augustinians for two consecutive terms. Born on September 14, 1955, in Chicago, Illinois, Prevost entered the novitiate of the Order of Saint Augustine (OSA) in 1977 and made his solemn vows in 1981. His educational background includes a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Villanova University in 1977, a Master of Divinity from Catholic Theological Union in Chicago, and both a licentiate and doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical College of St. Thomas Aquinas in Rome. His doctoral thesis was on “The role of the local prior in the Order of Saint Augustine.” His career in the Church has been marked by significant roles and achievements. After his ordination as a priest in 1982, Prevost joined the Augustinian mission in Peru in 1985 and served as chancellor of the Territorial Prélature of Chulucanas from 1985 to 1986. He spent the year 1987 to 1988 in the United States as pastor for vocations and director of missions for the Augustinian Province of Chicago before returning to Peru where he spent the next ten years heading the Augustinian seminary in Trujillo and teaching canon law in the diocesan seminary, where he was also prefect of studies. He also served in other capacities there, including as a parish pastor, diocesan official, director of formation, seminary teacher, and judicial vicar. In 1999, he returned to Chicago and was elected provincial prior of the “Mother of Good Counsel” province in the archdiocese. Two and a half years later he was elected prior general of the Augustinian and served two terms until 2013. In 2014, he returned to Peru when Pope Francis appointed him apostolic administrator of the Diocese of Chiclayo. He was elevated to Bishop of Chiclayo in 2015. While there, he also served as vice-president and member of the permanent council of the Peruvian Bishops’ Conference from 2018 to 2023. During that time, Peru’s bishops reportedly played an important role in ensuring institutional stability during the successive political crises that led to the overthrows of successive presidents. In 2020 and 2021, Prevost served as apostolic administrator of Callao, Peru. Pope Francis appointed Prevost prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops in January 2023, a powerful position responsible for selecting bishops, a position he held until Pope Francis died on April 21, 2025. On September 30, 2023, Pope Francis elevated Prevost to the rank of Cardinal. During his first months as prefect, then-Archbishop Prevost continued to remain characteristically discreet in the media, but was reportedly appreciated for his ability to listen and his mastery of issues. Aleteia reported that a French bishop who met him two months after he took office praised his “judicious questions” and his ability to synthesize, stressing that this first contact had left him with a “good impression.” On key topics, Cardinal Prevost says little but some of his positions are known. He is reportedly very close to Francis’ vision regarding the environment, outreach to the poor and migrants, and meeting people where they are. He said last year “the bishop is not supposed to be a little prince sitting in his kingdom.” Prevost appears somewhat less favorable to currying favor with the LGBTQ lobby than Francis, but he showed mild support for Fiducia Supplicans.1 Prevost has faced some controversy regarding clergy sexual abuse although he has been defended in both instances.2 The cardinal’s supporters stress his innocence and say the cases have been inaccurately and unfairly reported in the media. The first case involves his handling of a sexual abuse case during his time as provincial of the Augustinian Province of Chicago (1999-2001), when a priest convicted of sexual abuse of minors was allowed to stay at an Augustinian priory near an elementary school and continue functions as a priest until later removed, and then laicized in 2012. However, Prevost is said to have never authorized that particular situation, the priest was not an Augustinian, and it took place before the Dallas Charter.3 More recently, questions were raised about Prevost’s knowledge and handling of abuse allegations in his former Diocese of Chiclayo. Two priests were accused of molesting three young girls, with the allegations surfacing in April 2022 during Prevost’s tenure as bishop. The case has been a source of frustration for local Catholics due to its slow progress and unclear resolution. Some accusers have claimed Prevost failed to properly investigate the allegations and covered up for the accused priest, but the diocese has firmly denied this, stating that Prevost followed proper procedures. They stated that Prevost personally received and attended to the victims, and reportedly opened an initial canonical investigation. He also encouraged the victims to take the case to the civil authorities. In July 2022, Prevost sent the results of the investigation to the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (DDF) for review. His supporters stress that he has documents from the DDF and the Papal Nunciature in Peru which also indicate that he was not only attentive to the presumed victims, but that he did all required in Church law in following procedures set out for these cases.4 However, in May 2025 allegations emerged that the diocese paid $150,000 to the three girls to silence them. Described as “longtime public critics of Prevost,” the girls reportedly blame Prevost for covering up their sexual abuse by the priest. The allegations, reported in InfoVaticana, described the Peruvian scandal, which was the subject of a national television report including an interview with the girls last fall, as the “stone in the shoe for Cardinal Prevost.” Ahead of the 2025 Conclave, Cardinal Prevost was being promoted as a possible compromise candidate if leading candidates were unable to obtain enough votes. His lengthy missionary service in Peru allowed him to be seen as a more universal candidate than American which mitigated problems associated with choosing a pope from a superpower in his case. However, there was speculation that he might be considered too young and too recently made a cardinal to be seriously considered papabile with any significant chance of being elected. Continued questions over his handling of sexual abuse have also cast a cloud over his prospects. Cardinal Prevost is a member of seven Vatican dicasteries as well as the Commission for the Governance (Governatorato) of Vatican City State, indicating how much Pope Francis trusted the cardinal and valued his administrative abilities.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Prevost aligns closely with Pope Francis' vision on social justice issues, emphasizing outreach to the poor and environmental stewardship.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his discreet demeanor, Prevost is appreciated for his listening skills and ability to synthesize complex issues during negotiations.  
• Power Base: Prevost's extensive experience in various ecclesiastical roles, including his recent position as prefect of the Dicastery for Bishops, provides him with significant influence and credibility within the Church.

177,Jānis Pujats,"Cardinal Jānis Pujats is a retired conservative Archbishop of Riga (Latvia) and fearless defender of the Church’s teaching and apostolic tradition who faced communist persecution during Soviet occupation. Born on November 14, 1930, in Nautrēni parish, Latgale, Latvia, Pujats began his religious education at the Theological Seminary in Riga before it was closed by the Soviet Union in 1951. Despite this setback, Pujats was ordained in a secret ceremony by Archbishop Antonijs Springovičs just two months later. During his early career, Pujats focused on pastoral work in Riga parishes while also teaching art history and liturgy at the Catholic Theological Seminary. He played a crucial role in implementing the liturgical reforms decreed by the Second Vatican Council and was instrumental in publishing the first missal in Latvian. Pujats’ career progressed, and from 1979 to 1984, he served as Vicar General in the Metropolitan Curia. However, in 1984, he faced adversity when the KGB declared him a persona non grata, forcing him to return to parish work. A significant milestone in Pujats’ career came on May 8, 1991, when he was appointed Archbishop of Riga, receiving his episcopal consecration on June 1 of the same year. He also served as the President of the Latvian Bishops’ Conference. Pujats’ importance in the Catholic Church was further recognized when Pope John Paul II made him a cardinal in pectore on February 21, 1998. This appointment was made public during the consistory of February 21, 2001. As a cardinal, Pujats participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. Known for his linguistic abilities, Pujats speaks Russian, Polish, Lithuanian, German, and Latin, in addition to his native Latvian. He gained attention for being the only member of the Synod of Bishops to address the assembly exclusively in Latin during the 2001 and 2005 meetings. On June 19, 2010, Pope Benedict XVI accepted Pujats’ resignation as Archbishop of Riga. Throughout his career, he has been known for his traditional views on various Church matters and has been involved in publishing declarations reaffirming traditional Church teaching. In 2019, Cardinal Pujats joined Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke, and Kazakh bishops Tomasz Peta, Jan Paul Lenga, and Athanasius Schneider in signing the “Declaration of Truths” reaffirming the Church’s teaching. The declaration was created in response to what the signatories called “almost universal doctrinal confusion and disorientation.” The signatories also criticized some of Pope Francis’ teachings, including his Document on Human Fraternity. He has been a vocal critic of homosexuality, referring to it as “absolute depravity in sexual behavior” and an “unnatural form of prostitution.”1 In 2015, he accused the European Union of launching “an internal crusade against the Christian faith.” In comments made in the 2000s, Pujats said: “We are not hurrying to turn around the altars. When we build smaller churches, even today, I do not have the altar detached from the wall. I do not look upon it as an offense to anyone that the priest stands facing the altar to celebrate Mass.” On the Sacrament of Penance: “In many [nations] few people go to confess their sins, but they all go to Communion. I look on this as the biggest mistake that [Vatican II] ‘reformers’ have made. When they lifted the people onto their feet it was apparent to me that it would take two generations to get them back on their knees.” Cardinal Pujats speaks Russian, Polish, Lithuanian, German, and Latin, in addition to his native Latvian.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Pujats is a staunch defender of traditional Church teachings and apostolic tradition, often opposing modern interpretations of doctrine.

178,Vinko Puljić,"Cardinal Vinko Puljić is a retired Archbishop of Sarajevo with conservative views who worked tirelessly to bring peace to war-torn former Yugoslavia in the 1990s and heroically helped refugees fleeing the conflict. Born on September 8, 1945, in Prijećani, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Puljic grew up in a large, devout family, experiencing both poverty and strong faith from an early age. His spiritual formation was influenced by his family’s piety and the nearby Trappist Monastery of Marija Zvijezda. After completing his education and being ordained as a priest in 1970, Puljić served in various roles within the Church. He was a chaplain, parish priest, and spiritual director at a minor seminary, where he was known for his fatherly approach to the seminarians. On November 19, 1990, Puljić was appointed Archbishop of Vrhbosna, Sarajevo, becoming the sixth Archbishop of that See since the reconstruction of the ecclesiastical hierarchy in 1881. His tenure as Archbishop coincided with a tumultuous period in the region’s history, as the collapse of communism gave way to conflict in the former Yugoslavia. In November 1992, Pope John Paul II wrote that when he imposed his hands on Puljic on January 6, 1991 to consecrate him, he had “no idea that very shortly your cross would be so heavy and your cup so bitter.” Archbishop Puljić played a significant role in providing aid to refugees and advocating for peace. He frequently risked his life on pastoral visits to war-affected parishes and engaged in interfaith dialogue to promote unity and mutual respect. He was instrumental in helping thousands of refugees and exiles, mobilizing the local Church’s resources. According to the Vatican’s biography of the cardinal: “He began in particular to launch heartfelt appeals for the respect of the inalienable rights of the human person without distinction of race or religious creed, for the right of each to live in his own home, for mutual respect, for unity in plurality. At times, there was opposition to such appeals. In his tireless work of peace making, he met with many political figures and politicians, at home and abroad. In addition, to give a greater impulse to the commitment of religion for a just peace, he met more than once with the Orthodox and Muslim religious leaders of Bosnia-Herzegovina.” The Vatican biography goes on to say that although some did not agree with his attitude, Puljic “gained widespread esteem among the people and politicians, becoming a reference point at the most difficult moments and in the most acute crises” and that his radio and written messages were “always positively accepted by the people, both Catholic and Muslim and of other religions.” The cardinal has received several awards for his work, including honorary doctorates from Grand Valley State University (USA) and Catholic University of Santa Maria (Peru). Pope John Paul II recognized Puljić’s dedication and at the age of forty-nine elevated him to the rank of cardinal in 1994, making him one of the youngest members of the College of Cardinals at that time. Throughout his career, Cardinal Puljić has been an active participant in Church affairs, including the conclaves that elected Popes Benedict XVI and Francis. In April 1997, he welcomed John Paul II to Sarajevo, and he has served as President of the Bishops’ Conference of Bosnia-Herzegovina from 1995 to 2002, 2005 to 2010, and 2015 to 2020. In 2010, Cardinal Puljić faced a legal battle over his residence in Sarajevo, which was claimed by heirs of communist-era occupants. He strongly resisted the eviction notice. The Bosnian cardinal has been vocal about the declining Catholic population in Sarajevo, stating that it has become “solely a Muslim city.” He has criticized the international community for what he perceives as favoritism towards Muslims. Cardinal Puljić strongly opposes the blessing of same-sex couples. Regarding recent ceremonies blessing same-sex unions in Germany, he stated: “The divine comes first. I would not pretend to be a judge, but I cannot accept such views.” He considers proposals to bless same-sex couples as “exotic ideas” that are alien to the Church’s teachings. He was also critical of the German Synodal Way and its proposed reforms, calling them incompatible with the Gospel. He emphasizes returning to the “original Gospel” rather than embracing secularism or relativism. The cardinal has voiced his concerns about “religious arbitrariness” entering Church life and emphasizes the need to return to the Gospel. The cardinal expressed nuanced views about the Medjugorje phenomenon. He maintained that the official position of the bishops of Bosnia and Herzegovina was the one expressed by the then Bishops’ Conference of Yugoslavia in April 1991, namely that it “cannot be affirmed that these events concerning apparitions and revelations are of supernatural nature.” He has, however, stated that prayer at the site is allowed, and recognized its evangelical potential in generating “conversions and acts of grace.” Pope Francis accepted the cardinal’s resignation as Archbishop of Vrhbosna, Sarajevo, on January 29, 2022.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Puljić holds conservative theological views, emphasizing the need to return to the original Gospel and rejecting modern secular ideas that conflict with Church teachings.

Born on March 11, 1939, in Laoag City, Ilocos Norte province, Philippines, Quevedo spent his early years in the northern island of Luzon before his family moved to the Western Visayas region. As a young boy, he served Masses for the first Oblate missionaries in the Philippines, which inspired his vocation. He carried out his classical studies at the Notre Dame High School in Marbel and studied philosophy in the minor seminary of San Jose, Quezon City. Quevedo joined the Oblates of Mary Immaculate (O.M.I.) and pursued his religious formation in various locations.

180,Timothy Peter Joseph Radcliffe,"Cardinal Timothy Radcliffe, a former Master of the Order of Preachers (Dominicans), is a well-known progressive theologian whose views on some of the Church’s moral teachings, particularly homosexuality, have caused considerable controversy. Born on August 22, 1945, Radcliffe is one of six children who had a privileged upbringing: on his father’s side he descends from an Anglican clergyman whose own father had been raised to a baronetcy in the 19th century, adopting the name Radcliffe. On his mother’s side, he descends from a Portuguese Catholic who in the late 19th century married a female descendant of an aristocratic recusant Catholic family.1 As a child, Radcliffe attended Worth Abbey School in Sussex, and then Downside Abbey in Somerset, both prestigious and expensive Benedictine-run private schools in England. He joined the English Province of the Dominican Order in 1965 and was ordained priest in 1971. He studied at Blackfriars College and St. John’s College in Oxford, as well as in Paris under noted French theologian Yves Congar, a proponent of the contested Nouvelle Théologie liberal movement. He went on to serve as chaplain to the University of London from 1974 to 1976, then at the Imperial College of Science, before teaching scripture and doctrine at Blackfriars for twelve years. However, he was not, as some maintain, a professor at Oxford University nor a university appointed lecturer.2 He was prior of the Provincial English Province Dominicans between 1988 and 1992 after which he was elected Master of the Order of Preachers (the head of the Dominican Order), a position he held until 2001. Contrary to some inaccurate biographies, Radcliffe did not pursue a graduate degree at Oxford.3 He also does not have a doctorate. In fact, Radcliffe has not produced any scholarship; he rose through the ranks on account of him being a Dominican. Once elected Master of the Dominican Order, he gained a degree of prominence that enabled him to become a well known author. He was awarded honorary doctorates as a prominent Catholic. While he was Master of the Order of Preachers, Radcliffe traveled the world, founded Dominican Volunteers International and played a key role in helping to establish the Franciscan-Dominican representative offices at the United Nations, giving the Dominicans “Non-Governmental Organization status.” A close friend of the late Cardinal Basil Hume who hoped he would succeed him as Archbishop of Westminster, Radcliffe became a renowned theologian, preacher, and author who is largely celebrated by progressive theologians and proponents of liberal theology. His books have been translated into 24 languages. In 2007 he won the Michael Ramsey Prize, an Anglican award, for his theological writing. Radcliffe has also received numerous honorary doctorates, including from Oxford University, Fribourg University, and the Pontifical University of St Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum). He has served as patron of Catholic AIDS Prevention and Support and has been involved in the ministry to people with Aids, as well campaigning against nuclear weapons. Radcliffe has also spent eight years on the board of CAFOD and is a patron of the International Young Leaders Network. Although he had sought a simple life in Oxford in the 2000s after serving as head of the Dominicans, Radcliffe’s career gained a new lease of life after Pope Francis was elected and he found his progressive views closely aligning with those of the Francis pontificate. In 2015, he was appointed as a consultor to the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace, an appointment that coincided with his leadership at the time of the Las Casas Institute for Social Justice at Blackfriars, Oxford. In October 2023 and at the Pope’s invitation, Radcliffe offered spiritual reflections to members of the Synod on Synodality, beginning with a pre-synod retreat. At the synod’s second and final Rome meeting in October 2024, Radcliffe was given an expanded role, offering spiritual reflections throughout much of the month-long meeting as well as at a retreat before the assembly began. He spoke, among other topics, on the importance of listening and dialogue, being open to God’s Providence, and cautioning against fear-driven decision-making, whether fear of change or fear of staying the same. After Pope Francis announced in October 2024 he would elevate Father Radcliffe to the College of Cardinals, Radcliffe requested an exemption from dressing like a cardinal which the Pope granted in “full understanding,” freeing him “from using such elaborate clothing.” Radcliffe has not been without controversy when it comes to some of his comments on the Church’s moral teachings, and particularly relating to homosexuality. In 2005, as the Vatican debated whether men with same-sex attraction should be admitted to seminaries, following the clerical sex-abuse scandals, Father Radcliffe said the inclination should not bar men from the priesthood, but that those who oppose their candidacy should be. In a talk in Los Angeles in 2006, Father Radcliffe called on Catholics to “accompany [homosexuals] as they discern what this means, letting our images be stretched open.” He said this would mean watching Brokeback Mountain [the first major Hollywood movie to feature a love story between two leading homosexual roles], reading gay novels, living with our gay friends and listening with them as they listen to the Lord.” In 2012, in support of same-sex civil unions which the Vatican had always opposed, he wrote in The Tablet that homosexual relationships should be “cherished and supported” and that the “God of love can be present in every true love.” Radcliffe has often celebrated Masses for homosexual Catholics — the so-called “Soho Masses” — in London. Writing in an Anglican journal in 2013, he said same-sex relationships “can be expressive of Christ’s self-gift” and “expressive of mutual fidelity, a covenantal relationship in which two people bind themselves to each other forever.” He opposes “gay marriage,” saying it is not equivalent to marriage, as it is not “inherently unitive.” For many years, concerns have been raised about Radcliffe’s history of “pushing the boundaries of Catholic orthodoxy.” On homosexuality, critics say his comments contradict the Church’s teaching but that he obscures this by claiming to support the Magisterium while simultaneously questioning how it should be applied. His writings have been described as a “squid ink or smoke screen” attempting to avoid clear moral statements on homosexual activity. Others have accused him of using rhetoric that serves as a “trojan horse” to change the Church’s teaching on sexuality; they also point out that he fails to make clear distinctions between homosexual orientation, which the Church teaches is not sinful, and homosexual acts that are considered sinful. During the October 2024 synod, Cardinal Radcliffe was critical of the bishops of Africa who rejected Fiducia Supplicans, and he raised eyebrows by writing in L’Osservatore Romano that he believed African bishops had been “under intense pressure from Evangelicals, with American money; from Russian Orthodox, with Russian money; and from Muslims, with money from the rich Gulf countries.” He later issued a statement insisting his comments were not intended to suggest that stances taken by the African bishops “were influenced by financial considerations.” In statements on other issues, the English Dominican voiced his support for relaxing restrictions on Holy Communion for the divorced and civilly remarried before the 2014-2015 Synods on the Family. Writing in America magazine in 2013, he said he had two “profound hopes” — that a “way will be found to welcome divorced-and-remarried people back to Communion” and that women will be allowed to preach at Mass. Cardinal Radcliffe is a firm believer in synodality. He has warned in the past about “fear of debate” in the Church and “suspicion that if we really air our disagreements then the authority of the Church will be undermined.” He believes that courage and humility are needed to “dare to put a foot wrong” because “we cannot speak as those who have the truth wrapped up, unlike our ignorant and bigoted opponents!” For Radcliffe, it is important to trust in the Holy Spirit that “the truth will emerge” but admits that “we might not turn out to be right.”","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Radcliffe is a progressive theologian known for advocating a more inclusive interpretation of Church teachings, particularly regarding homosexuality and the role of women in the Church.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He demonstrates a collaborative and open-minded personality, emphasizing the importance of dialogue and listening in theological discussions and decision-making.

182,Álvaro Leonel Ramazzini Imeri,"Cardinal Álvaro Leonel Ramazzini Imeri is a Guatemalan prelate who has been dedicated to promoting social justice, peace and reconciliation in his country while also taking a firm line against abortion, same-sex “marriage,” and the death penalty. Born on July 16, 1947 in Guatemala City, Alvaro is the eldest of the four children of Ernesto Ramazzini and Delia Imeri. Both his parents were of Italian origin who had emigrated from Lombardy. After attending various schools in the South American country, he completed his schooling in the conciliar minor seminary of Santiago, also in the archdiocese of Guatemala. He studied philosophy and theology in the Salesian Theological Institute, and concluded his formation for the priesthood in Mexico, in the diocesan seminary of Mérida, in the Yucatán. He was ordained priest on June 27, 1971 and took care of the Seminario Mayor Nacional de La Asunción. In that period, between 1976 and 1980, he studied canon law at the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he was awarded a doctorate. Pope John Paul II appointed Ramazzini Bishop of San Marcos in 1988. In the diocese he recognized the value of agricultural resources and the dignity of rural workers. He also founded a “House of the Migrant” especially dedicated to the protection of unaccompanied minors. In 1990 he became secretary general of the Guatemalan Episcopal Conference, within which he has held numerous offices. He was elected president in 2006, completed his term in 2008 and went on to run the commissions for social communications and for justice and solidarity. He has also served as head of social pastoral care, of national Caritas, of the pastoral ministry of communications, of the pastoral care of prisoners, and of “movilidad humana,” a body providing immediate assistance to migrants, in terms of shelter. In 2012, Pope Benedict XVI transferred Ramazzini to become Bishop of Huehuetenango. Pope Francis elevated him to the rank of cardinal on October 5, 2019. Reflecting on his appointment, Ramazzini said: “I think the Pope is trying to change the idea that being a cardinal is something that gives you power and prestige.” As part of his social justice work, Cardinal Ramazzini has been a vocal advocate for indigenous rights, migrants, the poor, and the marginalized. During Guatemala’s civil war from 1960-1996, he also played a prominent role in promoting peace and reconciliation efforts, especially from within the Guatemalan bishops’ conference. He received the Pacem in Terris Peace and Freedom Award in 2011 for his social justice work, and has held leadership positions in the Guatemalan Episcopal Conference and contributed significantly to the Latin American Episcopal Council (CELAM). Known for his outspoken criticism of injustice and human rights abuses, he has received death threats due to his advocacy work. More recently, he has been a prominent voice supporting protests against alleged abuses of power by Guatemala’s attorney general. Respected by progressive groups for his social justice efforts, they have also criticized some of his views on issues such as abortion and same-sex “marriage” that align with Catholic doctrine. He has stated, “I do not agree with the approval of abortion nor the death penalty nor same-sex marriage. It’s logical; I am a priest.” His views on blessings for same-sex couples in light of Fiducia Supplicans are not known. Cardinal Ramazzini is a strong advocate for migrants and has made this a central focus of his work. He argues that as long as people cannot find jobs that pay enough to support their families, they will continue to migrate despite the dangers. He has called for a “strictly and essentially human” approach to migration and criticized policies that fail to protect migrants’ rights. At the same time, Ramazzini has also emphasized addressing root causes of migration, such as poverty and lack of economic opportunities in home countries. During his time as Bishop of Huehuetenango from 2013 to 2021, priest numbers increased slightly from 24 to 32, male religious remained low but the same (about 5), and female religious increased from 57 to 72.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Ramazzini promotes social justice and reconciliation while adhering to traditional Catholic doctrines against abortion, same-sex marriage, and the death penalty.

183,Albert Malcolm Ranjith Patabendige Don,"Cardinal Albert Malcolm Ranjith Patabendige Don — usually known simply as Malcolm Ranjith — was born in Polgahawela, fifty miles northeast of the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo. The eldest of four, Ranjith is the son of devout parents. His father was a railway station master whose work often took him from home, and Ranjith says his mother was the “great influence” in his life. Young Malcolm grew up in a village of strong, militant Catholics, proud of their traditions and feasts, and loyal to the Church and their priests. He became familiar with politics as a child, taking part in protests at age twelve after the socialist government decided to nationalize Catholic schools. Educated by Lasallian Brothers, he entered St. Aloysius Seminary in Borella at eighteen after being impressed by the witness of a French missionary. A year later, he transferred to the national seminary in Kandy to study theology and philosophy. He was soon sent by Archbishop Thomas Cooray to Rome, where he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in theology from the Pontifical Urbaniana University. Pope St. Paul VI ordained him priest in 1975 in St. Peter’s Square. From 1975 to 1978, Fr. Ranjith pursued postgraduate studies at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome, where he obtained a licentiate in Sacred Scripture. While there, he studied under Carlo Maria Martini and Albert Vanhoye (both later cardinals) and attended the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. On returning to Sri Lanka, he was quickly immersed in pastoral life in Pamunugama, where he helped poor fishermen in a village lacking running water, electricity, or adequate housing. He says the experience rooted his priestly ministry in the realism of life. Appointed auxiliary bishop of Colombo in 1991, he took the episcopal motto Verbum Caro Factum Est in the firm belief that priestly life should be about witnessing to the Incarnation of the love of God. Four years later, Pope John Paul II appointed him bishop of Ratnapura, and, in 2001, Ranjith returned to Rome as adjunct secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples (Propaganda Fide) and president of the Pontifical Missionary Aid Societies. In 2004, despite having no diplomatic training, he was appointed apostolic nuncio to Indonesia and East Timor and raised to archbishop. In December 2005, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, where he promoted a liturgy more in keeping with the Second Vatican Council’s Constitution Sacrosanctum Concilium. Benedict appointed him archbishop of Colombo in 2009 and elevated him to cardinal in 2010. In 2010, he was elected president of the Sri Lankan bishops’ conference. He remains a member of the Congregations for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, and for the Evangelization of Peoples. He is fluent in ten languages: Italian, German, French, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Spanish, English, Sinhalese, and Tamil. Born in 1947, he is beyond the retirement age of archbishops but remains in relatively good health apart from knee surgery and a bout of Covid in 2022. Cardinal Ranjith is an ecclesial all-rounder: a conservative and a polyglot with a deeply pastoral vision who has extensive experience in Church governance. Having relished serving poor fishermen as a young parish priest, he has effectively governed numerous dioceses as bishop, represented the pope as a papal diplomat in the world’s most populous Muslim country, overseen liturgical practices and served missionary dioceses as a high-ranking curial official, and governed a major metropolitan archdiocese as cardinal-archbishop in challenging times. He has lectured on Sacred Scripture and catechetics, set up institutes and commissions, and revitalized Church societies. The fruits of his work have included attracting a greater number of diocesan priests in his archdiocese, bringing many children to the Faith through his love of catechizing the young (he is popularly known as the “Children’s Bishop”), and spreading greater reverence for the liturgy across Sri Lanka by bringing back traditional liturgical practices. As the country has a more traditional society, he is less engaged with issues such as same-sex “marriage,” euthanasia, and life issues generally, but he takes an uncompromising view on each of them, firmly upholding the Church’s teaching, believing in the importance of protecting all human life, and condemning ideological colonization. Due to his upbringing and formation, he is deeply loyal to the papacy and the hierarchy and has had a frank and relaxed relationship with Pope Francis, with whom he shares a fervent concern for the poor. He has nevertheless been willing to depart slightly from Francis; for instance, Ranjith would allow the death penalty in certain cases, he clearly favors ethical capitalism, and he rejects socialism. He prefers the Novus Ordo celebrated reverently but has encouraged more celebration of the Traditional Latin Mass. He has been an advocate of the “reform of the reform” while also favoring a “return to the true liturgy of the Church.” In 2024, he banned girls from serving at the altar in parishes within his archdiocese.1 But he is also a firm proponent of the Second Vatican Council reforms and sees the post-conciliar Church as an imperfect yet necessary development in a process of dialogue with the world. Cardinal Ranjith takes a pronounced post-conciliar approach to religious liberty, willing to support the nation’s constitution in giving preference to Sri Lanka’s Buddhist majority as a vital bulwark against secularization. The Sri Lankan prelate is generally politically astute, has many contacts in government, but has been a persistent critic of the authorities, especially when it comes to matters of truth and justice. This became especially clear following the 2019 terrorist bombings in Sri Lanka and the lack of justice that continues to be elusive. He can be outspoken and sometimes impulsive but is recognized for being upstanding and willing to confront corruption. Similar to Pope Francis, he has been a strong advocate of environmental protection. Few cardinals have the breadth of experience Ranjith has gained over the years, making him a preferred candidate for those seeking a reliable, traditional, conservative pope more in continuity with Benedict than with Francis, but someone with a proven track record in governance and orthodoxy from the global south — this time from Asia, an area where the Church is growing relatively rapidly.","• Theology/Ideology: Ranjith embodies a conservative theological stance that emphasizes the importance of tradition while also advocating for the reforms of the Second Vatican Council.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his pastoral sensitivity and political astuteness, Ranjith balances firmness with a willingness to engage in dialogue, making him a pragmatic negotiator.

184,Gianfranco Ravasi,"Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi was born in the midst of the Second World War and has two younger sisters. He acknowledges that his childhood was deeply marked by alienation from his parents. During the war, his father, from whom he received an interest in art, was sent from Northern Italy to Sicily. His father deserted the army and arrived home eighteen months later, and little Gianfranco neither recognized him nor wanted him in the home. Gianfranco was very close to his mother but was separated from her to live with his aunt, where he took up studies in Greek and Latin. Then his mother died, an event he described as “a severe blow.” At a young age, he entered seminary and was ordained with a special exception when only twenty-three years old, in 1966. Jesuits supplied the bulk of his higher education, as he earned a degree at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and a license in Sacred Scripture at the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome (the Biblicum). He later studied archaeology at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. He taught Old Testament in Northern Italy for some time and served as prefect of the Ambrosian Library in Milan from 1989 to 2007. In 2007, Ravasi was appointed titular archbishop of Villamagna di Proconsolare by Benedict XVI and simultaneously made president of the Pontifical Council for Culture, the Pontifical Commission for the Cultural Heritage of the Church, and the Pontifical Commission for Sacred Archaeology. In 2010, Benedict created Ravasi a cardinal-deacon. A prolific writer, Ravasi has over 150 books to his name as author or collaborator, and he worked in a journalistic capacity for Avvenire, the daily of the Italian Episcopal Conference; L’Osservatore Romano, the Vatican daily; Il Sole 24 Ore; the weekly Famiglia Cristiana; and the monthly Jesus. He has been the recipient of many honorary doctorates, awards, and medals. In 2014, Pope Francis confirmed Ravasi as president of the Pontifical Council for Culture. About himself, Ravasi has said he is “motivated not by Mediterranean optimism but Northern pessimism.” He explains: “My search has always been for something permanent, for what is behind the transitory, the contingent. I’m fighting loss and death, which probably relates to the absence of my father in my first years.” Cardinal Ravasi retired from his position as President of the Pontifical Council for Culture on June 5, 2022, at the age of 79. His departure coincided with a reform of the Roman Curia under Praedicate evangelium, which led to the merging of the Pontifical Council for Culture with the Congregation for Catholic Education to form the new Dicastery for Culture and Education. The Italian cardinal’s engagement with culture presents Christ as a small part of a much larger mosaic composed of atheist, pagan, and non-Catholic thinkers. In favor of beauty in architecture and the liturgy almost as an abstraction, Ravasi has been a critic of the Extraordinary Form of the Mass. His homilies display a desire to invigorate listeners, to find the new language to engage the people of the current time, and he encourages priests to delve into Scripture more deeply for this purpose. Most of his public speeches are littered with literary or cultural references from across the socioreligious and political spectrum, demonstrating his breadth of knowledge and insatiable appetite for books and culture. Although now retired, he regularly takes to X to post verses and quotes not only from the Bible but also from non-Catholic sources and authors. Recently these have included the Talmud, the economist Adam Smith, and Marcel Proust. Many of his endeavors have shown questionable judgment at best — from actively participating in a pagan Pachamama ceremony in Argentina; to praising figures such as Martin Luther, Buddha, and deviant rock stars; to compiling a “prayer book” with atheist reflections and calling for fraternity with Freemasons. Many of his gestures are at the very least ambiguous. His notorious quote that Jesus “did not rise, he arose” led to suspicions in Rome. The Courtyard of the Gentiles initiative demonstrated his ability to make news with events intended to reach non-Catholics. Some events, however, have been unquestionably harmful, as in the support given to the blasphemous New York Met Gala in 2018, and other controversial events for which he was primarily responsible. Undoubtedly a public Catholic figure, his presence in journals, newspapers, books, and television has been almost unparalleled by other prelates. But many of Ravasi’s doctrinal and moral positions have more in common with the Protestants he praises than with Catholic tradition, such as his openness to women deacons, his vague notion of religious liberty, and his seeming unwillingness to speak clearly about unpopular moral norms. Indeed, notwithstanding his immense output of scholarly writings, there is little evidence that he has made definitive statements about the relationship of nonnegotiable moral norms, human rights, and public policy.","• Theology/Ideology: Ravasi presents a complex theological stance that often blends Catholic teachings with elements from other faiths and philosophies, reflecting a desire for dialogue with non-Catholic thinkers.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is characterized by a literary and cultural approach to communication, employing a broad knowledge base to engage diverse audiences, though his actions sometimes spark controversy.  
• Power Base: His influence stems from a combination of his high-profile positions within the Vatican and his extensive engagement with culture, media, and academia, making him a recognizable figure in contemporary discussions on faith.  
• Core Motivation: Ravasi's driving force appears to be a quest for deeper understanding and permanence in faith, shaped by personal experiences of loss and alienation during his formative years.","Cardinal Gianfranco Ravasi embodies a complex theological perspective that seeks to integrate Catholic teachings with insights from various faiths and philosophies, fostering meaningful dialogue with non-Catholic thinkers.

185,Giovanni Battista Re,"Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re, the Dean of the College of Cardinals, is an influential veteran senior Vatican official whose career in the Roman Curia spans five decades. Born on January 30, 1934, in Borno, Italy, Re was ordained priest in 1957 and holds a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. Re’s career in the Vatican began in 1963 when he joined the Roman Curia. He served as personal secretary to Archbishop Giovanni Benelli and held various diplomatic positions before being appointed as Secretary of the Congregation for Bishops in 1987. In 1989, he became the Substitute for General Affairs of the Vatican’s Secretariat of State, a key position responsible for the day-to-day running of the Holy See. He held the position for 11 years. In 2000 Pope John Paul II named him to the influential role of prefect of the Congregation for Bishops and president of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. He was elevated to the rank of cardinal in 2001. Re served in these positions until 2010, playing a crucial part in the appointment of bishops worldwide. As a senior cardinal, Re has participated in several notable events, including the conclaves of 2005 and 2013. On January 18, 2020, Pope Francis approved Re’s election as Dean of the College of Cardinals, a position of considerable influence.1 Cardinal Re has taken a strong stance against abortion. In 2009, he defended the excommunication of those involved in providing an abortion to a 9-year-old rape victim in Brazil, stating that “the twins conceived were two innocent persons, who had the right to live and could not be eliminated” and that “life must always be protected.” As prefect of the Congregation for Bishops, Re played a central role in Benedict XVI’s attempts to discipline former Cardinal Theodore McCarrick, which came to light following Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò’s 2018 Testimony and in the later “McCarrick Report.” In 2006, Cardinal Re instructed the Vatican’s ambassador to the United States, Nuncio Pietro Sambi, to convey to McCarrick that he should maintain a lower profile and minimize travel for the good of the Church. The instruction was given orally at first, and then in writing in 2008.2 Re declined to answer media questions on the McCarrick affair. In 2009, Re was also involved in the decision to remove excommunications from bishops of the Society of Saint Pius X. He signed and issued the decree, but the decision to lift the excommunications came directly from Pope Benedict XVI. Cardinal Re’s role was to execute the Pope’s decision through the official channels of the Congregation for Bishops. In 2020 as the newly appointed Dean, Cardinal Re sent a letter to all the cardinals claiming that the controversial China-Vatican agreement represented the views of Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI, and that Cardinal Joseph Zen was mistaken in his opposition. Cardinal Zen, a vocal critic of the Vatican’s approach to China, had previously written to his fellow cardinals in September 2019, expressing his concerns about the agreement. Zen responded to Re’s letter, challenging him to provide evidence of Benedict XVI’s approval of the agreement and questioning why it wasn’t signed earlier if that was the case. This dispute revealed deep disagreements within the hierarchy about the best way to engage with China and protect the interests of Chinese Catholics, with Cardinal Re and Cardinal Zen representing opposing viewpoints on the matter. Although conservative on some matters of Church doctrine, politically Cardinal Re has long been known to adhere to the views of Italy’s center-left. Despite his advanced age, Cardinal Re continues to wield significant influence in the Vatican. Cardinal Re has been a key adviser to Pope Francis in recent years, allegedly deterring the Pope from appointing a German bishop as head of the DDF in 2023.  Despite his advanced years, Re has also repeatedly stood in for the Pope at the altar during celebrations. He is known for his affable manner and efficient approach to issues and conflicts.

186,Baldassare Reina,"Cardinal Baldassare Reina, the vicar general of Rome, is a Sicilian prelate known for his commitment to the poor who since 2022 has been catapulted into the highest ranks in the Church. Born on November 26, 1970, in San Giovanni Gemini, Sicily, Baldassare Reina — affectionately known as “Don Baldo” — began his religious journey at the young age of eleven when he entered the archdiocesan seminary of Agrigento, Sicily. After completing major seminary, Reina went on to pursue higher education at the Pontifical Gregorian University, earning a bachelor’s degree in sacred theology in 1995 and a licentiate in biblical theology in 1998. He was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Agrigento on September 8, 1995, by Bishop Carmelo Ferraro. In his native Archdiocese of Agrigento, Reina held various positions. He served as the diocesan assistant of Catholic Action, vice-rector of the Agrigento seminary, and parish priest in different churches. From 2013 to 2022, he was the rector of the Agrigento seminary, a role he held for nine years, during which time he also taught Sacred Scripture. His diocese came under the spotlight in 2013 when Pope Francis chose it as his first destination outside Rome, visiting the island of Lampedusa. Reina’s bishop at the time, Francesco Montenegro, was also elevated to cardinal and is now retired. Father Reina first appeared on Francis’ radar in 2018, when he was received at the Vatican with seminarians from his diocese. In his speech, given off the cuff, the pontiff reportedly paid several compliments to the rector. Reina’s career took a significant turn in 2022 when he joined the staff of the Dicastery for the Clergy. In May 2022, Pope Francis appointed him as an auxiliary bishop of Rome and titular bishop of Acquae in Mauretania, and he was consecrated the following month in the Basilica of St. John Lateran. In a series of rapid promotions, Reina was named vicegerent of the Diocese of Rome on January 6, 2023, and raised to the rank of archbishop. He assumed additional responsibilities when the office of the vicar general for the Diocese of Rome became vacant on April 6, 2024. On October 6, 2024, Pope Francis announced Reina’s appointment as the new vicar general of the Diocese of Rome, replacing Cardinal Angelo De Donatis. Reina was elevated to cardinal on December 7, 2024. Cardinal Reina is known for his commitment to a “transparent and poor Church” and his desire to spread the “fragrance of the Gospel.” Aged just 53 years old when appointed vicar general of Rome, he was one of the youngest members of the College of Cardinals when chosen. As the vicar general and cardinal, Reina will play a crucial role in implementing Pope Francis’ vision for restructuring the Diocese of Rome, and overseeing the running of the 2025 Jubilee Year.1 He took over during a period of transition in the diocese, following the departure of Cardinal De Donatis, who had faced criticism for his handling of the Father Marko Rupnik case. Reina has been quick to address issues such as delays in construction work for the 2025 Jubilee. While not directly addressing abortion or euthanasia, Cardinal Reina has shown support for the sanctity of life. He spoke positively about Chiara Corbella Petrillo, a young Italian laywoman being considered for sainthood who chose to carry two terminally ill babies to term, having them baptized immediately before their deaths less than one hour later. While pregnant with a healthy third child, Chiara was herself diagnosed with cancer and died one year later after giving birth to a healthy boy. “We commit ourselves to imitating Chiara, because we are all called to holiness in our daily lives, in difficulties, in problems, in illnesses,” he said. “Chiara teaches us, together with an infinite host of men and women, that holiness is a possible path. It is the only path that makes us happy.” In 2024, Cardinal Reina was reportedly accused by a former seminarian, now an “LGBT” activist, of forcing him to undergo conversion therapy in order to cure him of his homosexuality. Cardinal Reina is reported to be a very active man who likes to take public transport and go by his first name. He said in a recent video: “I know it’s not an easy mission, because our city is beautiful, but extremely complex, unfortunately marked by many problems and difficulties.” He added that he wished to be “the image of the Good Shepherd for all.”","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Reina advocates for a ""transparent and poor Church"" while promoting the sanctity of life through personal narratives of holiness.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his approachable demeanor, he actively engages with the community and emphasizes the importance of empathy in leadership.  
• Power Base: His rapid ascension within the Church and role as vicar general of Rome position him as a key figure in executing Pope Francis’ vision and overseeing significant events like the 2025 Jubilee Year.

187,Roberto Repole,"Cardinal Roberto Repole, the Archbishop of Turin and Bishop of Susa, is a heterodox Church scholar closely associated with a group of Italian clerics attached to the progressivism of the 1960s and 1970s. He is also known for editing a 2018 volume on Pope Francis’ theology that controversially involved Benedict XVI. Born on January 29, 1967, in the Givoletto district of Turin, Italy, Repole was ordained a priest on June 13, 1992, by Cardinal Giovanni Saldarini. His academic journey is noteworthy, having completed his studies at the Liceo Valsalice in Turin and obtaining his bachelor’s degree in theology from the Faculty of Turin. He further pursued his education at the Pontifical Gregorian University, earning his licentiate in 1998 and doctorate in theology in 2001. Repole served as a parish vicar from 1992 to 1996 and then as a lecturer in systematic theology at the Theological Faculty of Turin and the Higher Institute of Religious Sciences in Turin from 1996 to 2022. His leadership roles include serving as the president of the Italian Theological Association from 2011 to 2016 and as the rector of the Turin section of the Theological Faculty of Northern Italy from 2016 to 2022. In February 2022, Pope Francis appointed Repole both Archbishop of Turin and Bishop of Susa. This appointment was notable as Repole was the first native of Turin to be named archbishop there since 1897 and the first graduate of the Turin Faculty of Theology to be named archbishop. In October 2024, Pope Francis announced that Repole would be elevated to the College of Cardinals on December 7 that year. The cardinal archbishop of Turin has a notable and strong association with Sergio Boarino, a key figure in the formation of a liberal group of priests known as “Boarinians” in the Turin archdiocese. A former rector of the Turin Major Seminary in the 1980s and 1990s, Boarino was a significant mentor to Repole and other priests during their formative years. Repole himself has described him as “an intelligent and good father.” The Boarinians, called a “sect” by their detractors, are an association of priests who maintain a strong bond with each other even after ordination, are characterized by a self-referential pastoral and ideological system; strong internal cohesion; and have a significant influence on the archdiocese of Turin. They are generally considered theologically and politically progressive, and have a tendency to interpret the “signs of the times” in continuity with the ideas of the 1960s and 1970s. The appointment of Roberto Repole as archbishop of Turin has been seen by some as an extension of the power and influence of the “Boarinians” in the diocese. This has provoked mixed reactions: the “Boarinians” see the appointment as an opportunity to extend their pastoral and ideological model to the whole diocese; others fear his appointment will accentuate divisions in an already highly polarized diocese. Cardinal Repole has a vision of the Church closely aligned with that of Pope Francis. He has expressed an openness to change, views issues in the context of contemporary and socio-cultural changes, and stresses listening and synodality. The key to Don Repole’s theological thought is that of “humility” — he proposes a humble Church, which assumes the style of the humble God and “humble thought.” Observers say it is a “soft theological version” of the philosophical style of “weak thought” coined by Italian philosopher Gianni Vattimo — an attempt to understand and re-configure traces from the history of thought in ways that accord with postmodern conditions. Critics say Repole’s vision of a humble Church “easily becomes the humiliated Church.” In 2018, Repole became embroiled in controversy when he edited La Teologia di Papa Francesco, an 11-volume series published by the Vatican printing house that analyzed Pope Francis’ theology. The publication drew international headlines as Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI was asked, but declined, to write an official note about the books because he was “surprised” by the inclusion of Father Peter Hünermann, a German theologian who had dissented from Church teaching and was one of Pope St. John Paul II’s strongest opponents. Also included in the series was Secondo lo Spirito by the ex-Jesuit Father Marko Rupnik who, five years after the series was published, was credibly accused of serially abusing female religious.1Catholic World Report asked the archdiocese of Turin and Susa why Father Rupnik had been selected as a contributing author to the series and whether he, Pope Francis, or someone else had selected him, but they received no response. The books were nevertheless publicized by Msgr. Dario Viganò, then prefect of the Secretariat for Communication, who admitted to intentionally deceiving the media by making it seem, in publicity photos, as though Benedict had endorsed the volume by omitting a key paragraph in the Pope Emeritus’ letter referring to his disapproval of the inclusion of Hünermann. It is not known if or to what extent Repole was involved in the “Lettergate” deception which led to Vigano’s dismissal as prefect.","• Theology/Ideology: Repole embodies a progressive theological stance that aligns closely with the vision of Pope Francis, emphasizing humility and synodality within the Church.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his collaborative approach, fostering strong internal cohesion among the “Boarinians” while navigating polarized opinions within the diocese.  
• Power Base: Repole's influence stems from his leadership in the progressive “Boarinians” group and his recent elevation to cardinal, which enhances his authority in the Church.  
• Core Motivation: His primary drive appears to be advancing a vision of a humble Church that engages with contemporary socio-cultural changes, albeit amid criticism of potential divisiveness.","Cardinal Roberto Repole exemplifies a progressive theological perspective that resonates with the vision of Pope Francis, emphasizing humility and synodality within the Church.

188,John Ribat,"Cardinal John Ribat, Papua New Guinea’s first ever cardinal, is a prelate with a passion for social justice, the environment, and ecumenism who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2016. Born on February 9, 1957, in Volavolo, East New Britain, Papua New Guinea, Ribat dedicated his life to the Church from an early age. After attending high school, he entered the Congregation of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart. He made his first profession in 1979, then studied philosophy and theology at the Holy Spirit Seminary of Bomana. He was ordained a priest on December 1, 1985. His early career involved working as a parish priest and furthering his studies in Manila. He also served as master of novices for the Missionaries in Suva, Fiji, demonstrating his commitment to nurturing future religious leaders. In 1997 he served as parish priest and from 1998 to 2000 was Master of Novices in Suva, Fiji Islands. Ribat’s ascent through the Church hierarchy was marked by several significant appointments. In October 2000, Pope John Paul II named him auxiliary bishop of Bereina and titular bishop of Macriana Minor. His consecration as bishop took place on February 11, 2001, and he was subsequently named Bishop of Bereina on February 12, 2002. His leadership qualities were further recognized when Pope Benedict XVI appointed him Coadjutor Archbishop of Port Moresby in April 2007. Ribat succeeded to this office in March 2008, assuming a pivotal role in the Papua New Guinean Catholic community. The pinnacle of Ribat’s ecclesiastical career came in November 2016, when Pope Francis elevated him to the rank of cardinal. This historic event made Ribat the first cardinal from Papua New Guinea, a significant achievement not only for him but for his entire nation. Pope Francis appointed him president delegate of the Synod on Youth in 2018. Cardinal Ribat’s achievements extend beyond his religious appointments. Queen Elizabeth II conferred a knighthood on him on June 12, 2016, in her Birthday Honors list, recognizing his contributions to both the Church and society. He was awarded both the Order of the British Empire (OBE) as well as the rank of Knight of the British Empire. He is therefore also known as Cardinal Sir John Ribat. The cardinal has been a firm believer in climate change theory and a vocal advocate for addressing it. He delivered an urgent message on “Climate Change, Sustainability and the Common Good” at the College of Mount St. Vincent, stating that climate change is no longer just a theory but a reality. He emphasized that “Mother Earth is crying, and we have to do something.” Cardinal Ribat has also raised concerns about mining on the ocean floor, warning that it could damage marine life and affect people’s livelihoods. He has been working to share the experiences of people in Papua New Guinea and other Pacific nations who are said to be at high risk from the effects of climate change. Cardinal Ribat, who comes from a family with Methodist relatives, has been a firm proponent of ecumenism. He has expressed pain regarding the inability of Catholics and Protestants to share Holy Communion, and appears to favor the same kind of inclusive yet controversial approach to Holy Communion as Pope Francis. He has stated that “both Catholics and Protestants have to live with the pain they have because they cannot share Holy Communion during Mass” and believes that the Catholic Church, as the “Mother Church,” should “embrace all.” As chairman of the ecumenical movement in Papua New Guinea, he promotes dialogue with Protestant denominations. Cardinal Ribat has engaged in dialogue with Muslims in his region, indicating a willingness to extend conversations about faith practices beyond Christian denominations. The cardinal does not appear to have weighed in on other issues such as abortion or same-sex blessings; his career has been mostly focused on steady progression and increasing responsibilities within the Church, culminating in his historic appointment as Papua New Guinea’s first cardinal.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Ribat advocates for social justice, environmental stewardship, and ecumenism, emphasizing the need for unity among Christian denominations.

Throughout his career, Ricard has been involved in various Vatican congregations and councils, including membership of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Pontifical Council for Culture. Ricard has been an influential voice within the Church, addressing issues such as the use of human embryos in scientific research and the wider use of the Traditional Latin Mass. He authored a book titled “Les Sept Défis pour l’Eglise” (The Seven Challenges for the Church) in 2003. In November 2022, Ricard admitted to sexually abusing a 14-year-old girl in the 1980s while serving as a parish priest. The cardinal said that his misconduct had “grave and lasting consequences,” for which he asked forgiveness.

Born on March 2, 1949, in Mascota, Jalisco, Mexico, he was ordained as a priest on July 20, 1976, and holds a degree in dogmatic theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University. His pastoral ministry consisted of serving as parochial vicar, chaplain for women religious, spiritual director then rector at the minor seminary of Autlán, diocesan consultor, and member of various commissions. He was vicar general of Autlán from 1985 to 1991. Robles Ortega’s ascent in the Church hierarchy began at the age of 42 when he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Toluca and Titular Bishop of Bossa. In 1996, he was installed as Bishop of Toluca, Mexico, marking the beginning of his leadership roles in significant dioceses. In 2003, Robles Ortega was installed as Archbishop of Monterrey, but his most notable appointment came on November 24, 2007, when Pope Benedict XVI elevated him to cardinal in recognition of his service and leadership within the Church. In February 2012, Cardinal Robles Ortega was installed as Archbishop of Guadalajara, Jalisco, México, where he continues to be an influential figure in the Church in Mexico and beyond. The cardinal is known for his active work in several areas of social and religious importance. He has reportedly been a vocal advocate for the elimination of relativism in secular institutions, addressing issues of poverty, emphasizing the importance of family, and working towards the active avoidance of drug infiltration in society. He maintains a firm posture against abortion in line with Church teaching, considering it an assassination. “Abortion is a total and absolute tragedy of a human being who is gestated,” he once said. However, he has also called for an end to stigmatizing women who abort their children in view of the suffering they experience afterward. In 2021 the cardinal expressed support for civil unions for same sex couples, despite Church documents explicitly opposing such a stance. People with “same-sex preferences,” he wrote on Twitter in 2021, have the legal right to protect their union, but that does not “equate it to marriage.” On the Eucharist, he advised attending Mass during Covid instead of watching it on television.

193,Sérgio da Rocha,"Cardinal Sérgio da Rocha is a Brazilian prelate, moral theologian and youth minister on the moderately progressive wing of the Church who surprised some Brazilian Catholics by rising rapidly up the ecclesiastical ranks to become a cardinal in 2016. Born on October 21, 1959, in Dobrada, São Paulo, Brazil, he was ordained as a priest on December 14, 1984, at the age of 25. Cardinal da Rocha pursued his theological studies at Nossa Senhora da Assunção Theological Faculty in São Paulo and later obtained a doctorate in moral theology from the St. Alphonsus Academy in Rome. His early ministry included serving as a parish priest, coordinator of youth pastoral ministry, and professor of philosophy and moral theology at various institutions. Da Rocha’s ascent in the Church hierarchy began with his appointment as Auxiliary Bishop of Fortaleza in 2001. He was subsequently appointed Coadjutor Archbishop of Teresina in 2007 and succeeded as Archbishop of Teresina in 2008. In 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as the Metropolitan Archbishop of Brasília. On November 19, 2016, Pope Francis elevated Sérgio da Rocha to the rank of Cardinal, assigning him the titular church of Santa Croce in via Flaminia. In 2020, he was appointed to his current position as the Archbishop of São Salvador da Bahia. Cardinal da Rocha has held several influential positions within the Brazilian Catholic Church and beyond. He served as the President of the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil from April 2015. His leadership extended to the Latin American Episcopal Council (CELAM), where he was the President of the Department of Vocations and Ministries. The cardinal took part in both synods on the family, and in 2018 Pope Francis named Cardinal da Rocha as the relator general of the Synod of Bishops on young people, faith, and vocational discernment, a role that underscored his expertise in youth ministry and theological matters. At that synod, the Cardinal emphasized the importance of listening to and involving young people in the synodal process. Da Rocha said the Church needs a “change of perspective,” renewing her spiritual ardor and apostolic vigor through the example of holiness of young people. The cardinal also spoke of the need to “overcome the scourge of clericalism,” saying that such an “elitist and exclusivist vision of vocation” leads to the belief that clerics have “all the answers and no longer needs to listen or learn anything, or that pretends to listen.” Clericalism, he added, “is a perversion and is the root of many evils in the Church: we must humbly ask forgiveness for this and above all create the conditions so that it is not repeated.” The synod’s final document threw up a number of concerns, namely regarding passages on homosexuality in connection with youth, and women in the Church, and the fact that synodality was inserted into the text despite it not being in the working document. To be appointed a synod’s relator general traditionally has been viewed as an indicator of papal support and perhaps even his chosen successor.  In 2023, Pope Francis further expressed his confidence in the cardinal when he appointed him a member of the Council of Cardinals, the select group that advises the Pope on Church governance and reform. Despite his expertise in moral theology, the cardinal is relatively discreet and little is publicly known about his views on Church teaching in the context of contemporary social and moral issues. However, in 2021, the cardinal drew criticism for celebrating a Mass “in memory of the victims of transphobia.” In his homily, Da Rocha decried violence against the “LGBTI+” population, listed the most violent places, and called for a “culture of fraternity and peace.”1”LGBT” Catholic movements hailed the event as a sign of support to their cause and a “gesture of love” while critics called it a political act against the doctrine of the Church and questioned the contention that homosexuals were being killed on the grounds of their orientation. Although the cardinal celebrated the Mass, he did not distribute Communion. The cardinal appears to be open to those who attend the Traditional Latin Mass. When he was Archbishop of Brasilia, he did not pose obstacles to the establishment of the traditional Institute of the Good Shepherd, nor did he oppose them constructing a small church for the celebration of a daily Mass in the Vetus Ordo. Cardinal da Rocha is reputed to be a fair pastor, easy to deal with and with a relatively low profile. He is a member of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America and the Dicasteries for Bishops and for the Clergy. Apart from Portuguese, it is not clear if the cardinal speaks any other languages.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Sérgio da Rocha is a moderately progressive moral theologian who advocates for the inclusion of youth and a re-evaluation of traditional clerical structures within the Church.

194,Arthur Roche,"Cardinal Arthur Roche, the current prefect of the Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, is the most influential Englishman to have worked in the Vatican for many years.1 Born in Batley Carr, West Yorkshire, in 1950, Arthur Roche was educated at Catholic schools before entering the seminary at St Alban’s College in Valladolid, Spain, where he received a degree in theology from the Jesuit Comillas Pontifical University. On returning to England, he was ordained priest in 1975 by Bishop Gordon Wheeler, Bishop of Leeds, and his early career was spent entirely in his home diocese, where he was private secretary to Wheeler, vice-chancellor of the diocese, served on the staff of St Anne’s Cathedral, and was parish priest of St Wilfred’s Church, Farnley. After obtaining a Licence in Theology at the Gregorian University in 1991, Roche served as spiritual director of the Venerable English College and in 1996 succeeded the future Cardinal Vincent Nichols, Archbishop of Westminster, as general secretary of the Bishop’s College of England and Wales. In 2001 he was named an auxiliary bishop in the Diocese of Westminster and in the following year coadjutor to the Bishop of Leeds, David Konstant. In 2004 Roche became the ninth Bishop of Leeds, and during his time in office also served as chairman of the International Commission on English in the Liturgy; he was therefore responsible for supervising the 2011 publication of the new English translation of the Roman Missal, whose more literal rendering of the Latin was criticised by some liturgical scholars as antiquated and conservative. Bishop Roche’s successful introduction of the new translation led to his appointment as Secretary of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, now a dicastery, and in 2021 Roche succeeded Cardinal Robert Sarah as its prefect. In 2022 Pope Francis made him a cardinal and also a member of the Dicastery for Bishops. Since his ordination as a priest, Cardinal Roche had been regarded as a cleric who was being fast-tracked to hold high office. After Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O’Connor retired as Archbishop of Westminster in 2009, he was regarded as one of the bishops most likely to succeed him. That he did not do so may have reflected the fact that, despite the relatively conservative style of worship that he favoured in his own cathedral, his work to promote a more accurately translated Missal and his avoidance of theological controversy, Bishop Roche was the member of the English hierarchy most distrusted by liturgical traditionalists inspired by the thinking of Pope Benedict XVI. In 2007, immediately after Pope Benedict issued the motu proprio Summorum Pontificum that removed most restrictions on the celebration of the Tridentine Mass in parishes, Bishop Roche of Leeds issued an “interpretation” of the document that was clearly designed to restrict the use of the Old Rite as much as possible while ostensibly implementing it. This interpretation argued that permission to introduce the traditional Mass into a parish, granted by Pope Benedict to a “stable group of the faithful,” applied only to parishioners already belonging to the parish where it was requested. It also implied that these parishioners should be existing devotees of the Old Rite rather than those who wished to begin attending it. This was an erroneous interpretation of Summorum Pontificum, as the pontifical commission Ecclesia Dei made clear in its Instruction Universae Ecclesiae, emphasising that Pope Benedict was “offering to all the faithful the Roman Liturgy in the Usus Antiquior.” According to unofficial reports, Bishop Roche’s hostile implementation of Summorum Ponitificum reflected the wishes of Cardinal Murphy-O’Connor, who had strongly opposed Pope Benedict’s removal of restrictions on the Tridentine Mass; the Leeds “interpretation” might have served as a blueprint for the undermining of Summorum Pontificum throughout England and Wales had not Rome intervened. Bishop Roche was also a controversial figure in Leeds for other reasons. In 2010 he had announced a programme of church mergers and closures that cut the number of parishes in his diocese almost by half. In the previous year he had closed seven parishes in the Pontefract and Wakefield region of the diocese, provoking an unprecedented level of fury from parishioners who resented not only the decision but what they perceived as the bishop’s cold and lofty manner. In one protest, about 40 parishioners of St. John the Evangelist chained themselves to church railings, lit candles and sang hymns. The credibility of Roche’s insistence that such radical closures were financially inevitable was later undermined by revelations that by the time he left Leeds the diocese was heavily in debt as a result of episcopal overspending. Moreover, in 2012, management consultants from the Kinharvie Institute concluded that the aforementioned parish reorganisation had been badly managed, leaving “significant levels of disappointment, sadness, pain and especially anger” in its wake. Such bad press did not impede Cardinal Roche from being appointed to one of the most influential offices in the Roman Curia, but these and other episodes were likely embarrassing for a prelate whose reputation had been built on his supposed administrative skills. Although observers have described the cardinal as a church bureaucrat with few theological or other academic qualifications, he is not without skill as a writer of theological reflections. In 2023, Bishop Robert Barron’s Word on Fire published The Gardens of God, a collection of retreat talks by Cardinal Roche. It contains, perhaps surprisingly given his restrictions on the Traditional Latin Mass, a fruitful reflection on the Roman canon, whose Latin description of the bishops as fidei cultoribus, argues Roche, presents an image of God as a gardener that is impossible to convey fully in English. The Cardinal writes: “The word cultor comes from the Latin verb colo, colere, which means ‘to cultivate.’ A cultor fidei is someone who cultivates faith like a gardener cultivates the land. He is someone who plants a tree in the soil that reaches to the heavens! The word ‘column,’ interestingly, has the same derivation. Classical architecture makes it easy for us to recognize trees in the magnificent columns of Greece and Rome where we see before our eyes stone trunks of trees whose capitals bear the semblance of branches and foliage. “The cultor is someone who plants and harvests, who works and cares for the crops, the vines, who keeps bees and tends the beasts. These are all the original Latin usages. So, from within the context of the Eucharistic Prayer, we can say that bishops and priests are gardeners and farmers, as well as shepherds! They have to work at ground level, in the dust, among the weeds in God’s field. “The cultor belongs to the land, which is one of the reasons why bishops have a specific territory in their titles. It is here, in his territory, that he plants and cultivates and brings in the harvest.” The ideas in this essay were welcomed by some theological conservatives, but arguably, given the context – the importance of episcopal authority – they also point to one of the less appealing characteristics of Cardinal Roche: his own authoritarian record as the holder of episcopal and curial office. This weakness was starkly illustrated in 2021, after Pope Francis published his motu proprio Traditionis Custodes that swept away many of the freedoms granted to the Old Rite faithful, making clear that the Pope eventually wished to see the 1962 Missal banned from parishes churches and the 1970 Missal recognised as “the unique expression of the Roman Rite.” The then Archbishop Roche, as the Vatican’s new head of Divine Worship, was responsible for implementing the ruling. He did so in a notably high-handed manner, sometimes exceeding his brief. In an attempt to justify the motu proprio, in 2023 Roche went so far as to state on BBC radio that “the theology of the Church has changed.” Serious questions were also raised about Roche’s grasp of the subject. In a letter to Cardinal Nichols of Westminster, the then Archbishop Roche claimed that the Traditional Latin Mass had been “abrogated by Pope Saint Paul VI.” This was factually incorrect. As Benedict XVI pointed out in a letter to the world’s bishops accompanying Summorum Pontificum, “this Missal was never juridically abrogated and, consequently, in principle, was always permitted.” Archbishop Roche also said that he had been unable to find any evidence that Pope Paul VI had granted a faculty to English Catholics for the celebration of the Tridentine Mass following an appeal from artistic luminaries including Agatha Christie, Vladimir Ashkenazy, Kenneth Clark and Iris Murdoch. Yet the precise details of the faculty, set out by Archbishop Annibale Bugnini, had been made public in 1971 and were readily available on the internet. Cardinal Roche’s relentless and canonically questionable implementation of Traditionis Custodes appears to have damaged his reputation in the eyes of bishops, especially in the English-speaking world, who may not like the Old Rite but deplore the harshness of the cardinal’s attitude and the undermining of their own powers to regulate the liturgy in their own dioceses. In 2024, for example, Cardinal Nichols cancelled the long-established celebration of the Tridentine Holy Week ceremonies in his diocese. It is reported by many sources that he did not want to do so, but was having his arm twisted by Roche. While Pope Francis was hospitalized in February and March 2025 and the prospects of a conclave had grown, Cardinal Roche appeared to backtrack on his severe Traditionis Custodes line. “There is nothing wrong with attending the Mass celebrated with the 1962 missal,” he said in an interview. “That has been accepted since the time of Pope St John Paul II, Pope Benedict and now Pope Francis.” But he said it is not the “norm” as the Council had “decided to move away from what had become an overly elaborate form of celebrating the Mass.” He then criticized the Old Mass by saying it was short and perfunctory when he served at it as a boy. He also observed that today the numbers of those devoted to the Vetus Ordo “are, in reality, quite small” but some of them are “quite clamorous” and are “more noticeable because they make their voices heard.” Roche said in the interview that due to Vatican II, the Novus Ordo has more of an emphasis on Scripture, and that the 1962 missal has “a much lower percentage of scriptural readings”  than “in the newer missal.”  He continued by saying it was a “mistake” to become too angry about the issue, adding that from his perspective, “the celebration of the Eucharist, in whichever missal you are using, should be very noble and marked by noble simplicity.”  “I often hear people say, ‘Cardinal Roche is against the Latin Mass.’ Well, if they only knew that most days I celebrate Mass in Latin because it is the common language for all of us here. It is the Novus Ordo Mass in Latin,” he said. “I was trained as an altar boy until the age of 20, serving the Tridentine Form.” Some commentators were quick to note inconsistencies in the cardinal’s position and a surprising softening of his position in the shadow of an impending conclave. The prefect of the Dicastery for Divine Worship also suffers from the perception, dating back to his days as general secretary of the Bishops Conference of England and Wales, that he likes to emphasise the grandeur of his office and has spent an inordinate amount of time in expensive restaurants. Indeed, Arthur Roche’s manner and lifestyle is a much livelier topic of discussion among the clergy than his theological opinions, which are bland rather than distinctive. His tone is neatly captured by his reaction to Amoris Laetitia, which he praised extravagantly without touching on the sensitive question of whether it permitted divorced-and-remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion: “It’s very easily read – and it’s a very joyful read – because it’s a very encouraging message that the Holy Father is giving to the world on marriage and the family,” Archbishop Roche told Vatican Radio. He continued: “It’s a light in a very obscure world which really doesn’t believe in the family and in marriage as much as the Church does, so it will be of enormous encouragement to people throughout the world as they make their steps towards marriage – particularly young couples who live in a world that is full of challenges and full of change – because here we have a document which is joyful, and brings to them, really, the tenderness of God.” Cardinal Roche’s unreserved praise for Pope Francis is one of his hallmarks. It is not, however, evidence that he can be considered part of the Holy Father’s inner circle of advisers.2 Cardinal Roche’s public views on other matters pertaining to the Church and society are less well known. However, he regularly posts pro-life, anti-abortion stories on his X account, listed under a pseudonym. Other posted stories include opposing gender ideology and euthanasia, and during the 2024 U.S. presidential election, he expressed concern about anti-Catholic words and actions of presidential candidate Kamala Harris. He has also shared his strong support for synodality. He has called it “an immense gift to the Church” because he believes it “teaches us to listen very carefully to people, rather than simply becoming aggressive apologists.”","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Roche advocates for a liturgical approach that balances tradition with contemporary understanding, though his interpretation of liturgical texts has drawn criticism from traditionalists.

199,Ángel Sixto Rossi,"Cardinal Ángel Sixto Rossi is an Argentine Jesuit prelate and a prolific writer who has been a close friend of Pope Francis since 1976 and shares a similar vision for the Church as the Roman Pontiff. Born on August 11, 1958, in Córdoba, Argentina, Rossi entered the novitiate of the Argentine Province of the Society of Jesus in 1976. He was ordained priest on December 12, 1986, after completing his studies in philosophy and theology in Argentina and Ecuador. Rossi’s academic achievements include earning a degree in spiritual theology from the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, where he wrote a thesis on spiritual discernment in Saint Ignatius. He took his solemn vows as a Jesuit in 1994. Throughout his ecclesiastical life, Cardinal Rossi has been known for his commitment to social causes and spiritual guidance. From 1990 to 1992, he served as the rector of the Church of El Salvador in Buenos Aires, where he opened the Hogar San José for homeless people. In 1992, he founded the Manos Abiertas Foundation, which provides assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable in ten cities across Argentina. Rossi has held several significant positions within the Jesuit order, including serving as novice master from 1992 to 1995 and as superior of the Jesuit community residence in Córdoba from 2013 to 2019. He is also known for offering numerous Ignatian spiritual exercises to groups of priests, religious, and lay people. On November 6, 2021, Pope Francis appointed Rossi as Archbishop of Córdoba and he was consecrated archbishop the following month. Francis elevated him to the rank of cardinal on September 30, 2023, assigning him the title of Cardinal-Priest of Santa Bernadette Soubirous. Cardinal Rossi is known for his prolific writing, having written and co-written numerous works on spirituality and education for both youth and adults. One of his notable publications is the book “Teresa,” released in 1999, which helped popularize the “little way” of St. Thérèse of Lisieux among Spanish-speaking readers. He is often described as a close friend of Pope Francis, sharing both Argentine nationality and membership in the Society of Jesus. His work has been characterized by a strong commitment to serving the poor and addressing social disparities in Argentina. Cardinal Rossi has declared himself against abortion and believes “abortion is not a religious issue” but a broader question. He describes himself as someone “more simple and pastoral” rather than a theologian or intellectual. Like Francis, the cardinal also emphasizes that the cardinalate must be understood as a service and not as an office of power. He insists on the importance of humility and simplicity in the exercise of this role, as well as the importance of listening, dialogue and discernment in the Church.

He has expressed concern about the situation of young people, especially in relation to school dropouts and vulnerability to drugs. With regard to the Synod on Synodality, Cardinal Rossi said he hoped participants would “be able to listen to each other, to dialogue and to discern the challenges facing the Church and the world.” He emphasized the importance of putting the person at the center of the deliberations. Sixto Rossi has been unafraid to weigh in on politics. He has been critical of Argentine President Javier Milei, saying in 2025 his “cruelty is neither Christian nor human.” Regarding comments Milei made in 2025 linking of homosexuality with pedophilia, the cardinal said it “speaks of disrespect and ignorance.” He added: “It’s a style of expression we’re already familiar with; it’s done us a lot of harm, and we don’t like it. This aggressiveness is starting to wear thin, and even his own people are starting not to like it.” At the same time, he criticized the Government for cutting medicines for retirees: “It is a kind of covert euthanasia,” he said. He has also been critical of US President Donald Trump, saying: “The Pope asked him to make the United States a land of opportunity, to build a more just society, and to have leadership that inspires unity, solidarity, and communion. It seems as if Trump read this and said, ‘I have to do everything backwards.’” The Cardinal added: “Trump must not forget that he is the president of the United States, not the president of the world.”","• Theology/Ideology: Rossi shares a vision of the Church that emphasizes humility, service, and the importance of social justice, aligning closely with Pope Francis.

Cardinal Rueda has emphasized the centrality of the Eucharist in the life of the Catholic faithful. In his first Eucharist as cardinal, celebrated in St. Peter’s Basilica, he stressed the importance of having a living relationship with the heavenly Father, resembling Christ, having His feelings and seeking to act and think like Him every day. Recalling the words of Pope Francis, Cardinal Rueda pointed out the importance of being like a symphony orchestra that plays a single melody despite differences, articulating rather than comparing. He has also highlighted the importance of silence in liturgical and spiritual life, and stressed the need to cultivate silence in order to listen to the voice of God, to others and to ourselves.

The cardinal implemented stringent anti-COVID protocols that included closing the Monserrate Shrine and he fully backed the Covid-19 vaccination campaign despite questions over their safety and efficacy, saying to be vaccinated was “the best way to protect everyone’s life and health.” During the 2024 Christmas Season, the Cardinal allowed the Bogota cathedral to be used for a theatrical performance, which caused a major outcry from the faithful of the archdiocese.

Cardinal Rugambwa has defended youth facing migration challenges. In a July 2022 report, he urged members of the Association of the Regional Episcopal Conferences of Central Africa (ACERAC) to defend the youth as they are vulnerable to the hardships of migration. The Tanzanian cardinal appears to be aligned with traditional Catholic teachings, emphasizing faithfulness to the example of Christ. He has expressed concerns about the spread of ideas that promote “exaggerated freedom” and the influence of secular ideologies on Africa. His has also spoken of his fears of sectarianism and the challenge of other Christian denominations attempting to draw Catholics away from the Church. On synodality, Cardinal Rugambwa has encouraged “building the synodal and missionary Church by emphasizing unity, participation and mission in service.” He has not directly weighed in on same-sex blessings declaration Fiducia Supplicans and Africa’s opposition to the document. But he has stressed the importance of valuing African perspectives. When asked about those who might disregard the views of African Catholics, he said: “If they don’t value that, that is their problem. That’s their problem.

203,Camillo Ruini,"Cardinal Camillo Ruini is a retired former Vicar of Rome who played a significant role in shaping both ecclesiastical and political landscapes in Italy and fought to maintain the Church’s influence and relevance in an increasingly secular society. Born on February 19, 1931, in Sassuolo, province of Modena, diocese of Reggio Emilia, he studied philosophy and theology in Rome at the Pontifical Gregorian University. As a student of the Almo Collegio Capranica, he obtained a licentiate in philosophy and theology. He was ordained priest on December 8, 1954. In 1957 he returned to Reggio Emilia and taught philosophy at the diocesan seminary until 1968. From 1968 until 1986 he taught dogmatic theology at the ‘Studio Teologico Interdiocesano di Modena-Reggio-Emilia-Carpi-Guastalla’, where he was also headmaster from 1968 to 1977. From 1977 to 1983 he taught dogmatic theology at the ‘Studio Teologico Accademico Bolognese’. From 1958 to 1966 he served as chaplain to Catholic University graduates and from 1966 to 1970 he served as a delegate for Catholic Action. From 1968 he was president of the John XXIII Diocesan Cultural Center. In 1983, he was appointed Auxiliary of Reggio Emilia and Guastalla. As vice president of the Preparatory Committee, he contributed to the realization of the Ecclesial Convention of Loreto (1985) which has become a reference point in the dialogue between the Church and Italian society following the wounds of the 1960s and 1970s. In 1985, he was elected member of the Bishops’ Commission for Catholic Education, Culture and School. Ruini was elevated to the rank of cardinal in 1991 by Pope John Paul II, marking the beginning of his most influential period in the Church. He served as the President of the Italian Episcopal Conference from 1991 to 2007, a position that allowed him to exert considerable influence over the direction of the Catholic Church in Italy. During this same period, from 1991 to 2008, he also held the important position of Vicar General of the Diocese of Rome, effectively acting as the Pope’s representative in the administration of the diocese. Cardinal Ruini’s tenure was marked by his active engagement in both religious and political spheres. He was known for his ability to shape Catholic Church and political opinion in Italy, often taking strong stances on various social and moral issues. His leadership during this period was characterized by a commitment to maintaining the Church’s relevance and influence in an increasingly secular society. Cardinal Ruini was outspoken in his opposition to homosexual rights. Ruini warned that giving full legal recognition to unmarried couples would represent an “eclipsing of the nature and value of a family and a very grave harm to the Italian people.” In 2005, he received an award for his stance against full recognition of same-sex relationships. In the same year, he was very active in the mass media and was the strongest voice of the Church against a referendum advocating the liberalization of Italy’s legal restrictions on artificial insemination. The referendum failed to pass and Ruini was praised for his strategy to prevent the referendum from passing and his determination to speak out. The Italian cardinal was also known for his views on the relationship between faith and politics, as well as his perspectives on the challenges facing the Catholic Church in modern Europe. He frequently addressed issues such as secularism, Islam, and what he perceived as the “naturalistic tendency of modern man,” which he considered a significant threat to religious faith. In recent years, Cardinal Ruini has faced health challenges. He was hospitalized for heart disease, though he was subsequently discharged, demonstrating his resilience even in his later years. Despite stepping down from his official roles, Ruini has continued to be a respected voice within the Catholic Church, often commenting on contemporary issues and the direction of the Church.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Ruini emphasizes the importance of maintaining the Church's influence in a secular society while advocating for traditional family values.

204,Stanisław Ryłko,"Stanislaw Marian Rylko was born in Andrychow, Malopolska region. He was ordained a priest in 1969 by Cardinal Karol Wojtyla. After studying in Krakow and Rome and working in the Krakow archdiocese, where he was, among other things, vice-rector of the seminary, he held various positions in the Vatican since 1987 until retirement. In 1995 he became secretary of the Pontifical Council for the Laity and titular bishop of Novika. He was appointed a cardinal in 2007 by Pope Benedict XVI. From 2003 to 2016, he presided over the Pontifical Council for the Laity. He was also a member of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, the Congregation for Bishops, the Pontifical Council for the New Evangelization and the Pontifical Commission for Latin America, and a member of the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses. He participated in the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis. In 2017 he was appointed archpriest of the Basilica of Our Lady Major, and since 2018 he has been a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Vatican City State. In 2009, by order of Polish President Lech Kaczynski, he was awarded the Commander’s Cross with Star of the Order of Rebirth of Poland and in 2015 Polish President Andrzej Duda awarded him the Grand Cross of the same order. Cardinal Rylko is one of a number of prelates who have worked in the Roman Curia for decades. His career there lasted for thirty years. During this time he dedicated himself to serving the Church and very rarely gave interviews. His views on controversial topics are therefore largely unknown. From his many years of work at the Pontifical Council for the Laity, one can conclude that the cardinal supports the development of lay movements in the Church, and has repeatedly said that not only clergy, but also lay missionaries are needed in evangelized countries. “To be a missionary, a witness to the faith is an integral part of our Christian identity. The whole Church is missionary by its very nature. And in our time, the Church’s mission of evangelization faces many daunting challenges in the religious, social, cultural, economic and political fields,” he said in 2012 at the African Congress of the Laity. Despite this commitment to the topic of the laity, he has never spoken on the Synod on Synodality. When it was convened the cardinal was no longer in office. In dealing with the laity, the cardinal has devoted many of his addresses to defending the family and threats to the family posed by the modern world.1 While he was still President of the Pontifical Council of the Laity, Cardinal Rylko emphasized the need for Catholic families to adhere fully to the teachings of the Gospel, despite the prevailing culture. “Many are choosing not to get married,” he said, “and there is a huge increase in the number of cohabiting couples and of people getting divorced. The gap is widening between the Church magisterium and the actual lives of the faithful. We are undoubtedly facing a dangerous post-modern cultural shift that threatens the fate of humankind. In our times it often happens that when the Church speaks out about the nature of family and marriage (union between a man and a woman) and its indissolubility, faithful and fruitful conjugal love and openness to life, it may seem like a voice ‘crying in the wilderness’ that is often contested, rejected and even ridiculed by the media. However this voice cannot and must not fail to be heard.” Commenting on the Synod of Bishops on the Family, he said in 2014: “At this point, in the context of the Synod, there are some basic questions that Catholic spouses above all must ask: do I really live my marriage and family life according to God’s plan? Have I the courage to trust fully the Gospel of the family proclaimed by the magisterium of the Church? In spite of my limitations and my weakness, do I try to give witness to the beauty of marriage and the Christian family environment in which I live?  The pressure of post-modernity in this field is extremely strong and many give in to its destructive dictates. Unfortunately, even among the ranks of the baptized, attitudes of rejection (explicit or implicit) are now spreading like wildfire, as well as choices that stand in stark contrast to the Church’s magisterium. This brings much suffering to married couples and especially to children because of failed marriages.” The cardinal also noted that civil law should protect the family, saying: “It is necessary to guard the family, to defend it in the face of so many threats today. Particular care must be taken to establish wise laws that respect the nature of marriage and the family, which do not destroy but support these institutions fundamental to human existence. Unfortunately, we know that this is often not the case. We cannot remain silent and indifferent in this area.” Cardinal has Rylko stressed that “faith is not a private matter,” offering a grave diagnosis of  the ills plaguing the Western world. Recalling Benedict XVI, he said we are witnessing the death of faith in modern man, who has become weaned from contact with God, and thus has lost sensitivity to Him. According to the cardinal, “the best response to this widespread lack of certainty and reference points are movements that form Christians with a solid and mature faith.” On another occasion, the cardinal said: “The modern world today is experiencing a profound crisis. Widespread relativism breeds a void in the field of values, meaning, truth. There are no permanent and certain points of reference; everything is fluid. As a result, there is a growing number of people who are uprooted, people who have lost the foundations of their own existence somewhere along the way. (…) there is a clear and strong message addressed to young people: the foundation necessary for building the house of one’s life exists, and it is the living person of Jesus Christ! Only in Him can a person find the answer to the deepest questions, anxieties and desires of his heart.” Cardinal Ryłko also noted that “the great drama of our time is the exclusion of God from the horizon of human life which is happening for the first time in history on such a scale.” He lamented that God is denied the right to be present, especially in public life. We are at a moment,” he said “when the fate of our civilization is being decided: whether it will be a civilization of life or a civilization of death.” The cardinal also expressed his belief that “humanism without God becomes inhuman humanism, sooner or later turning against man.” At the same time, the Polish cardinal has repeatedly said that Christians are called to bear witness in today’s world to the sanctity of human life and to God. “Today too much attention is paid to the so-called ‘prophets of doom,’ as Paul VI used to call them. There is a proliferation of analyses and diagnoses of the situation of faith in today’s society breathing great pessimism or even some kind of catastrophism.” He said he was not denying that problems exist, but believes “that we cannot be blind to the good that is happening in the Church and the world.” “The Holy Spirit has not stopped working in our time at all! Church movements show that, despite the progressive process of secularization, in the lives of many laymen today there has been a great ‘qualitative leap’ when it comes to living the faith, the radicalism of evangelical choices, or involvement in the Church’s evangelization mission. There is no shortage of signs of authentic Christian maturity and testimonies of true holiness among the laity. There is also a new generation of young people growing, often referred to as the ‘John Paul II generation,’ who are not satisfied with the consumerist lifestyle imposed by modern culture, who are looking for the deeper meaning of their existence and find it in Christ, in the Gospel, in the Church.” Cardinal Rylko is not generally regarded as papabile for the upcoming conclave mainly due to his advanced age. However, if he were to become pope, it is conceivable that he would focus on issues affecting the laity, especially the family. He also sees threats to the Catholic faith coming from the world and its depraved “modern culture.” As a Polish hierarch influenced by the thought of John Paul II, with whom he worked closely, he would certainly advance many aspects of the vision of the Polish Pope.2","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Ryłko emphasizes the need for a strong, evangelizing Church that actively engages laypeople in its mission, particularly in defending traditional family values against modern cultural threats.

205,Grzegorz Ryś,"Cardinal Grzegorz Ryś was born in 1964 in Kraków. He graduated from Krakow’s renowned Fifth High School and then from a higher seminary and studied Church history, eventually earning a professorship in the field. Since the early 1990s, he has collaborated with Catholic press and periodicals and commented on the numerous pilgrimages of John Paul II to his homeland on Polish radio and television. From 2007 to 2011, he held the office of rector of the Major Seminary of the Archdiocese of Krakow, and organized the National Seminary for Senior Candidates for Holy Orders, which has been operating in Krakow since 2014. On July 16, 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Ryś auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of Krakow with the titular see of Arcavica. On September 14, 2017, Pope Francis appointed him Archbishop Metropolitan of Lodz. On September 30, 2023, Pope Francis created him a cardinal, assigning him the rank of cardinal-priest. On November 21, 2020, Pope Francis appointed him a member of the Congregation for Bishops and on October 4, 2023, he simultaneously appointed him a member of the Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. Cardinal Ryś participated in the Synod on Youth as a delegate of the Polish Bishops’ Conference, and in the Synodality through a personal papal appointment. He is the author of more than forty scientific and popular publications on history, theology and spirituality, and is a well-known retreat master and publicist. In 2018, the President of the Republic of Poland, Andrzej Duda, awarded him the Golden Cross of Merit, a high Polish civilian state decoration bestowed “for meritorious service to the State or citizens.” Since his appointment as archbishop of Lodz until 2022, vocations remained stable except for numbers of female religious which fell 12.5%. Cardinal Grzegorz Ryś is seen in Poland as an extremely progressive bishop, as Poland’s “Pope Francis man.” This reputation has largely evolved due to his openness and willingness to engage in dialogue, although some find it difficult to clearly understand his precise stance. He rarely wades into topical controversial discussions on the Church, but when he does, he echoes Francis’ positions. His elevation to the cardinalate was seen as a reward and encouragement for trying to change Poland’s rather conservative Church. It is worth noting that since he has held an important position in the Vatican’s Dicastery for Bishops, some new bishops with a more progressive attitude than their predecessors have been appointed in Poland. All of them, like Cardinal Ryś, are strongly promote the Church’s new synodal way. However, in comparison with Western bishops, Cardinal Ryś may even come across as a conservative. He quite adamantly opposes legalized abortion and euthanasia, allows the traditional Latin Mass as long as adherents do not dissent from Vatican II, and has defended the presence of the cross in public spaces. He has an orthodox belief in the Eucharist and as a Church historian, and he speaks and writes often on the authenticity and historicity of Scripture. If Cardinal Ryś were to become Pope, he would likely devote most of his energies to his key interests of interreligious dialogue and ecumenism, minimizing the differences between Protestants and Catholics, and strongly emphasizing relations with the Jews. He would undoubtedly be a follower of John Paul II in this regard, whom he has repeatedly cited in his ministry as a great authority. It is doubtful that he would be interested in matters of liturgy which seem to be a secondary topic for him, even though Francis appointed him a member of the Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. In 2021, he caused an uproar when he discarded liturgical norms and canons at a large open-air youth event. Despite his casual approach to liturgy and his strong emphasis on interreligious dialogue, in which one can sometimes find elements of blurring the differences between faiths, Cardinal Ryś believes in the Holy Trinity and that Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world, as well as the doctrine of original sin. He even affirms the teaching that some sins will not be forgiven, a belief that is not at all so prevalent among today’s bishops. Ryś is also committed to evangelization in an increasingly secularized society. In sum, Cardinal Grzegorz Ryś is a figure of complex personality and character, which makes him one of the most distinctive prelates in the Polish Episcopate. He is a highly communicative person who avoids distance in his dealings with the laity and often engages in dialogue with young people, which is evident in the evangelization events he organizes. His approach to pastoral ministry is innovative and often non-standard, which sometimes leads to controversy. Cardinal Ryś is also known for his critical approach to the Church’s involvement in politics, which he emphasizes in his speeches, pointing out the need for the Church’s conversion regardless of the political situation.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Ryś is a progressive theologian who emphasizes interreligious dialogue and ecumenism while maintaining orthodox beliefs on key doctrines.

206,Louis Raphaël Sako,"His Beatitude Cardinal Louis Raphaël Sako, the Chaldean Catholic Church’s most senior cleric, has helped lead Iraqi Christians through profoundly challenging times including the rebuilding of the country after the US-led invasion and the extremist Islamic attacks that followed. Born on July 4, 1948, in Zakho, Iraq, he completed his primary studies in Mosul and then attended the local Dominican-run Saint Jean’s Seminary. He was ordained priest on June 1, 1974, and served at the Cathedral of Mosul until 1979. Sako pursued higher education in Rome, earning a doctorate in Eastern patrology from the Pontifical Oriental Institute, and later obtaining a doctorate in history from the Sorbonne in Paris. His academic achievements led to his appointment as rector of the Patriarchal Seminary in Baghdad from 1997 to 2002. Upon returning to Mosul he guided the parish of Perpetual Help until his election as Archbishop of Kerkūk in 2003. His leadership skills and dedication to the Church were recognized when he was elected as Patriarch of Babylon of the Chaldeans on January 31, 2013, during a Synod convened in Rome by Pope Benedict XVI. Throughout his tenure, Cardinal Sako has faced numerous challenges, including the exodus of Christians from Iraq following the 2003 U.S. led invasion and the rise of extremist groups. He has been a vocal advocate for the rights and safety of Christians in Iraq, often speaking out against sectarian violence and political corruption. Pope Francis elevated Patriarch Sako to the cardinalate in 2018. One of the most notable events in his career was his instrumental role in organizing Pope Francis’ historic visit to Iraq in 2021 during the height of the COVID-19 emergency. The visit was seen as a significant moment of hope and unity for the country’s beleaguered Christian community. Cardinal Sako has been vocal about the challenges faced by Christians in Iraq, including forced migration. He has expressed concern over the exodus of Christians from Iraq and has advocated for their rights and safety. His relocation in 2023 from Baghdad to the Kurdistan Region in protest against political decisions affecting the Church also highlights his active engagement with issues of displacement, marginalization, and migration affecting his community. Cardinal Sako has taken a firm stance against blessing same-sex unions. In July 2024, he reaffirmed the Chaldean Catholic Church’s position, stating that they do not recognize same-sex unions as marriage and will not bless them “to preserve the sanctity of marriage.” He emphasized that for Chaldean Catholics, the blessing of marriage is a sacrament, not merely a blessing, and cannot be conferred on LGBT individuals. The Chaldean Catholic Church, led by Cardinal Sako, allows for married priests. This is evident from the ordination of Father Amar Agag, a 38-year-old married man with three children, as a Chaldean Catholic priest in France in September 2024. Cardinal Sako presided over this ordination. Cardinal Louis Raphaël Sako has expressed clear views on the liturgy, particularly regarding language use and adaptation to contemporary needs, particularly in terms of language. He therefore advocates the use of Arabic in the Chaldean Catholic Church’s liturgy, arguing that this is not a betrayal of tradition but rather a necessary adaptation to meet the needs of modern worshippers. He emphasizes that many Chaldeans no longer understand Syriac or Chaldean, making Arabic essential for comprehension. The cardinal supports updating liturgical practices to make them more accessible and meaningful to contemporary believers. He sees this as part of the Church’s ongoing mission and in line with the teachings of the Second Vatican Council. While advocating change, Cardinal Sako stresses that liturgical changes should remain within the framework of tradition. He distinguishes between essential elements of the Chaldean liturgy and artificial additions made over time. Sako views the use of vernacular language in liturgy as part of the Church’s missionary vocation. He believes it allows for better proclamation of Christ’s salvation to people of the present time. The Iraqi patriarch describes the liturgy as “the strongest expression of the Church’s living faith” and not merely a “show.” He sees it as the work of Christ himself, calling believers to participate in the Paschal Mystery. Cardinal Sako has had challenging interactions with Iraqi political figures. In 2023, he faced a significant crisis when Iraqi President Abdul Latif Rashid revoked a decree recognizing Sako as the head of the Chaldean Catholic Church, leading to his decision to relocate from Baghdad to Erbil in the Iraq’s Kurdistan Region out of protest. Sako has been in conflict with Rayan Al Kildani, leader of the Christian militia known as the Babylon Brigade. He accused Al Kildani of running a “deliberate and humiliating campaign” against him and of attempting to seize Church properties. Despite these challenges, Cardinal Sako remains committed to his role and the welfare of Iraqi Christians. He has expressed his readiness to “give up [his] life for the Church” and continues to advocate for a civil and democratic regime in Iraq. Linguistically versatile, Cardinal Sako is fluent in several languages. In addition to his native Arabic and Chaldean, he knows German and speaks French, English, and Italian.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Sako advocates for the use of Arabic in the Chaldean Catholic Church’s liturgy, emphasizing adaptation to contemporary needs while maintaining traditional elements.

207,Leonardo Sandri,"Cardinal Leonardo Sandri is a retired Argentine Holy See diplomat and senior Vatican official who served as deputy Vatican secretary of state under Pope St. John Paul II and announced the Polish pontiff’s death to the world in 2005. Cardinal Sandri is currently vice dean of the College of Cardinals. Born on November 18, 1943, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to Italian immigrant parents, Sandri began his journey in the priesthood after studying humanities, philosophy, and theology at the Metropolitan Seminary of Buenos Aires. He was ordained priest on December 2, 1967, by Archbishop Juan Carlos Aramburu. Following his ordination, Sandri pursued further studies, earning a Licentiate in Theology from the Pontifical Catholic University of Argentina and later a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Gregorian University. His diplomatic career in the Holy See began in 1974 when he became an official of the Apostolic Nunciature in Madagascar and Mauritius. Sandri’s career progressed rapidly, serving in various important roles within the Vatican. He worked in the Vatican Secretariat of State and served as a permanent observer of the Holy See before the Organization of American States from 1989 to 1991. In 1997, he was appointed Apostolic Nuncio to Venezuela, becoming the first Argentinian to hold this title. In 2000, Sandri was named Apostolic Nuncio to Mexico, and later that year, he became the Substitute (deputy) for General Affairs in the Secretariat of State, a key administrative position in the Roman Curia. During Pope John Paul II’s declining health, Sandri often read aloud the texts that the Pope could not deliver himself. Notably, on April 2, 2005, he announced the death of Pope John Paul II to the world from St. Peter’s Square. Pope Benedict XVI appointed Sandri as Prefect of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches in 2007, a position he held until 2022. In the same year, he was created Cardinal-Deacon of San Carlo ai Catinari. Throughout his career, Sandri has been involved in various important matters within the Church, including addressing the emigration of Christians from the Holy Land and calling for an end to the forced removal of Christians from Iraq and Syria. In 2018, Pope Francis elevated Sandri to the rank of Cardinal Bishop, and in 2020, he was elected as vice dean of the College of Cardinals.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Sandri emphasizes the importance of dialogue and reconciliation in addressing the challenges facing the Church today.

208,Robert Sarah,"Cardinal Robert Sarah is a traditional and orthodox minded former senior Vatican official whose prophetic witness, personal sanctity, and literary works have brought him a wide and devoted following across the world. Born on June 15, 1945, in Ourous, Guinea, to parents who were converts to Christianity from animism, after middle school he was obliged to leave home in order to continue his studies at the minor seminary in Bingerville, Ivory Coast. Following Guinea’s independence in 1958, he returned home, completed his studies, and was ordained priest on July 20, 1969, in Conakry. After his ordination, he earned a licentiate in theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome and a licentiate in Scripture at the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum in Jerusalem. Upon completion of his studies, he was nominated rector of the minor seminary of Kindia, and served as parish priest in Boké, Katace, Koundara, and Ourous. In 1979, he was appointed archbishop of Conakry at the age of thirty-four, making him the youngest bishop in the world and earning him the nickname the “baby bishop” from John Paul II. As archbishop, he lived under the Marxist dictatorship of Ahmed Sékou Touré, who put Sarah on a hit list. In October 2001, John Paul II appointed Sarah secretary of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, a post he held for nearly a decade. On leaving Guinea to take up the post, he was awarded the country’s highest honor by Guinea’s leader, General Lansana Conté, but the decoration did not prevent Sarah from publicly criticizing the regime’s corruption and poor administration.1 Benedict XVI appointed Sarah president of the Pontifical Council Cor Unum in 2010 and elevated him to cardinal the same year. He took part in the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis. In 2014, Francis nominated Sarah prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, a position he held until 2021. Sarah served for a time as a member of the Congregations for the Evangelization of Peoples and for the Causes of Saints and a member of the Pontifical Committee for International Eucharistic Congresses. He continues to be listed as a member of the Dicasteries for the Oriental Churches, the Causes of Saints, Evangelization, and Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. He speaks French, Italian and English fluently. At the time of the last conclave, Cardinal Sarah hardly figured on papabile lists, serving at the time as president of the Pontifical Council Cor Unum, in which he was quietly helping Benedict XVI to instill greater fidelity to the Church’s teaching among Catholic charities. But even then, he demonstrated a certain fearlessness and measured outspokenness in defending the Faith for which he has become well known and that many of his Western brother cardinals have noticeably lacked, particularly when it comes to sensitive elements of the Church’s moral teaching. He went on to speak with greater authority after Pope Francis appointed him prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, from where he could draw attention to one of his great concerns: the loss of the sacred and the need to defend the faith from the spirit of the age that had rejected it — but which remains central to Christians in Africa. As prefect, he favored “reform of the reform” when it came to the liturgy — to revisit and refine the liturgical changes implemented after the Second Vatican Council by addressing shortcomings and abuses while maintaining the core principles of Vatican II’s liturgical renewal. He placed particular importance on promoting the Mass ad orientem, spoke strongly in favor of Communion on the tongue, and argued against intercommunion between Catholics and non-Catholics. He also warned against the danger of Pharisaism in some traditional liturgical circles. Cardinal Sarah spoke almost apocalyptically at the 2015 Synod on the Family about the contemporary evils of abortion, the same-sex agenda, and Islamism. His 2019 book From the Depths of Our Hearts, written in conjunction with Benedict XVI on the crisis of the priesthood and in defense of priestly celibacy (the book was controversially released just ahead of the release of Pope Francis’ apostolic exhortation on the Amazon synod that threatened to end mandatory priestly celibacy) further cemented his image as a faithful and orthodox Church leader. Although hamstrung by internal opposition and so prevented from fulfilling his aims as head of the Vatican’s liturgy office, he was undeterred in confronting the crisis of relativism and secularism in the Church, in promoting a spirit of true evangelization, and in appealing to resist further succumbing to the spirit of the age. He usually kept silent in the face of some deep concerns about Francis’ pontificate, staying out of the 2016 dubia controversy and debates over papal pronouncements and instead offering oblique warnings. This reticence to criticize the Pope is also partly attributed to his closeness to Opus Dei which has managed some of his media relations and has a policy of not publicly criticizing the Pope or bishops. Pope Francis allowed Cardinal Sarah to continue beyond his five-year mandate, which expired in November 2019. He turned 75 on June 15, 2020, and offered his resignation as prefect of the Congregation which Francis accepted on February 20, 2021. Sarah responded to the news with a message on Twitter in which he declared: “I am in God’s hands. The only rock is Christ. We will meet again very soon in Rome and elsewhere.” Since his resignation, he has made an increasing number of public statements and appearances and is very active on social media. His X (ex-Twitter) account has over 140,000 followers. Since 2021 and the ending of covid restrictions he has visited a large number of countries, preaching, offering recollections for priests, religious or lay people, and giving academic conferences and media interviews. His experience in resisting a Marxist dictatorship is often credited for the cardinal’s sensitivity in knowing when to speak out and when to keep quiet, as well as his fearlessness in defending truths of the Faith. This became especially evident after his retirement from the curia, and in recent years he has been expressing himself with even greater freedom and clarity by the written word but also through homilies, conferences, interviews and spiritual talks. In a homily at the Holy Family Basilica in Nairobi, Kenya in February 2023, he warned: “Our faith can be rocked by those even within the Church who seek to change God’s revealed truth, sowing confusion rather than fostering clarity and confirming the faith. Such confusions in teaching threaten our Christian foundation and the very fabric of society.” As can be witnessed through the themes he chooses to address, he is seeking to “foster clarity and confirm the faith.” Even before he had retired from the curia, Sarah was well known for writing a number of highly acclaimed books, most notably his three-volume series: God or Nothing: A Conversation on Faith (2015); The Power of Silence: Against the Dictatorship of Noise (2017); and The Day Is Now Far Spent (2019).  Thanks to these works, many began to recognise in the cardinal a leader with depth, insight, and even a gift of prophecy that resonated with those who had felt starved of hearing the truths of the Faith firmly rooted in the Church’s Tradition. His most recent books helped to further burnish that reputation and include Couples, Awaken Your Love (2021); a Catechism of the Spiritual Life (2022); For Eternity: Restoring the Priesthood and our Spiritual Fatherhood (2023); and He Gave Us So Much: A Tribute to Benedict XVI (2023). Since leaving the curia, the cardinal has played a major role in supporting Catholics who attend the traditional Latin Mass in the face of growing persecution from Rome, and took up a leading role in countering the promotion of the blessing of same-sex couples, becoming one of the most vociferous critics of Fiducia Supplicans. He has also warned against the dangers of the current “Synod on Synodality.” In July 2022, the influential French weekly magazine Paris-Match published a six-page report under the title “Who is Cardinal Sarah,” with a cover portrait of the Guinean prelate. It presented him as having “enormous influence” and being a “Pope-maker,” and brought him into the lime-light internationally despite his having stepped down from official circles of authority within the Church. The article was criticized in the secular press in France but even in doing so, the state radio station “Radio France Internationale” presented him as “the most respected cardinal in Africa.” Far from having lost his status in the Church with his retirement in 2021, Cardinal Sarah has gained in notoriety and recognition as a defender of the faith. For some years, he has been regarded — especially by the more orthodox Catholic wing of the Church — as a leading contender to be the first African pope since Pope Gelasius I in the fifth century.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Sarah advocates for a traditional and orthodox interpretation of Catholic teachings, emphasizing the importance of liturgical reform and the preservation of sacred practices.

210,Odilo Pedro Scherer,"Cardinal Odilo Pedro Scherer, who heads the world’s third largest diocese, is a non-traditional but theologically moderate prelate whom the media touted as a potential papal candidate during the 2013 conclave. Born on September 21, 1949, in São Francisco, Cerro Largo, Brazil, Scherer comes from a family with German roots and is related to Cardinal Alfredo Scherer of Porto Alegre (1903-1996). He was ordained a priest on December 7, 1976, and has since built an impressive career within the Church. Scherer’s educational background includes a doctorate in theology and a master’s degree in philosophy from the Pontifical Gregorian University. His academic prowess has been evident throughout his career, having served as a professor of philosophy and theology at various institutions. He served as rector and professor at São José Minor Seminary in Cascavel and of the Seminary Maria Mãe of Igreja in Toledo. He was also rector of the Nossa Senhora de Guadalupe seminary and philosophy professor at the interdiocesan theology centre. Scherer also has experience of pastoral and curial work, serving as parochial vicar, parish priest and as an official at the Congregation for Bishops in the Vatican (1994-2001). In terms of his career in the hierarchy, Scherer has held several significant positions. He was consecrated Auxiliary Bishop of São Paulo in February 2002. In May 2003 he was elected general secretary of Brazil’s bishops’ conference, and in December 2006, the Pope appointed him adjunct general secretary of the Fifth General Conference of the Latin American Bishops. In March 2007, he succeeded Cardinal Claudio Hummes as Archbishop of São Paulo, and Pope Benedict XVI elevated him to the rank of cardinal later that year. Scherer has been a member of some influential Vatican dicasteries including Clergy, Culture and Education, and Evangelization. Additionally, he serves on the Council for the Economy. One of Scherer’s notable achievements has been serving as Grand-Chancellor of the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo (PUC-SP) since 2003. Cardinal Scherer has been unafraid to speak out about various issues. In 2007 he criticized liberation theology’s use of Marxism as a tool of analysis, although he supports its focus on social injustice and poverty. Two years later, he echoed Benedict’s concerns over the dangers of secularism by speaking out against the removal of crucifixes from public places in Brazil, and arguing that it would not serve the interests of Brazilian secularism.1 In 2007 Scherer expressed concerns about priests becoming “showmen” and has criticized the transformation of Mass into a show. In 2021, he defended Traditionis Custodes, Pope Francis 2021 apostolic letter that imposed sweeping restrictions on the traditional Mass, saying that “rejecting or discrediting a supposed ‘new Mass’ also involves a theological mistake and, certainly, a doctrinal error.” He said there is only one “Mass of the Ages” and that it finds its apogee in the reformed Mass. He believes the restrictions were aimed at “safeguarding the unity of the Church,” adding that as the liturgy is the “highest form of prayer in the Church” and part of the Church’s Magisterium, “its prescriptions must be fully respected by all, as a sign of communion of faith in the same Church of Christ.” He has been consistent in firmly opposing abortion. Scherer has used his social networks to reaffirm the Church’s position on the right to life of the unborn child, citing the example of St. John the Baptist recognizing the “embryo Jesus” while still in the womb. The cardinal stressed in 2018 that a law penalizing induced abortion was “at the service of a very high value, which is the life of the unborn child, its first and most fundamental right.” Scherer has also consistently spoken about migration. In a 2010 article he wrote that “it is necessary to develop global migration policies adjusting international efforts to local norms in order to safeguard migrants’ and their families dignity.” He has also called for the overcoming of divisions, unjust relations, and indifference toward things that go against human dignity, particularly in relation to migrants. The cardinal has expressed significant opinions on the Eucharist, considering it to be a “sublime Sacrament,” and has underscored its fundamental role in the life of the Church. He has stressed that the Eucharist is a good belonging to the Church as a whole, not the property of specific individuals or groups. He has also emphasized the unifying power of the Eucharist, and the importance of celebrating it with dignity. Scherer has also addressed the importance of receiving Holy Communion properly, and has expressed concern for the interior attitude of the faithful when receiving the Eucharist, as well as the observance of correct liturgical practices. The Brazilian cardinal has been criticized for his cautious approach to political issues. During the 60th anniversary of Brazil’s 1964 military coup, some criticized the fact that Scherer and the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil (CNBB) did not release any statement, despite the regime’s history of human rights abuses. Scherer has also faced criticism for his handling of an abuse allegation. In 2021, he was accused of downplaying a priest’s alleged abuse of a teenager. The cardinal received the allegations and opened an investigation to determine if they were credible. The victim claimed the priest had got him drunk and raped him. The archdiocese determined that the relationship, which lasted three years, was consensual and not abusive. The archdiocese also argued that the victim was an adult, although his national ID card proves that he was seventeen when the abuses reportedly began. Canon law stipulates that the age of sexual consent is eighteen, and it’s considered a crime in Church law. The cardinal was accused of breaching article five of Vox Estis, which calls on ecclesiastical authorities to ensure that those who state that they have been harmed, together with their families, are to be treated with dignity and respect. The alleged abuse case emerged a year after the archdiocese of Sao Paolo had created a commission to investigate allegations of sexual abuse linked to the Church. The cardinal noted at the time that, even before the creation of the commission, the archdiocese had looked into several complaints and even dismissed clerics after investigation and judgment of the cases. In 2017, Scherer supported a controversial food policy in São Paulo in which he defended a plan to use flour made from food leftovers to add nutrients to food distributed to the poor and homeless. During the COVID crisis, Cardinal Scherer was an avid promoter of vaccines despite persistent questions over their ethical nature, safety, and effectiveness. He said he was “deeply concerned” about vaccine resistance, and saw it as possibly due to misinformation, supported by “ideological prejudices and political motivations.” One of the most prominent figures resistant to the vaccine was Brazil’s President at the time, Jair Bolsonaro. Cardinal Scherer is fluent in Italian, German, and Portuguese. Observers say this linguistic versatility, combined with his German-Brazilian heritage, positions him as a bridge between different cultures within the Church.","• Theology/Ideology: Scherer is a theologically moderate prelate who emphasizes the unity of the Church and the importance of liturgical practices.

211,Christoph Schönborn,"Born in the ancestral castle of his noble family, with two brothers and a sister, the cardinal was given the name of Christoph Maria Michael Hugo Damian Peter Adalbert Schönborn. Months after his birth, his family was forced to flee what is now the Czech Republic to Austria, where he was raised. When he was fourteen, his parents divorced — an event that affected him deeply. When he was eighteen, Christoph entered the Order of Preachers, initially saddening his mother, Eleonore (who died in February 2022 aged 101), as he had been a “great help in all life situations.” He studied at the Dominican house of studies in Walberberg, Bonn, Germany, and earned a doctorate at Le Saulchoir, studying also at La Sorbonne university, and the Institut Catholique, all in Paris, as well as in Vienna for some time. In 1970, he was ordained a priest, after which he served as a university chaplain from 1973 to 1975 and then as a faculty member at the University of Fribourg from 1976 to 1991. During his tenure as professor in Switzerland, he became acquainted with Joseph Ratzinger and served as secretary of the commission of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to edit the new Catechism of the Catholic Church (1987-1992). Schönborn was consecrated a bishop in 1991 by Cardinal Hans Hermann Groër, O.S.B., archbishop of Vienna. From 1995 to 2025, he was been Metropolitan Archbishop of Vienna. Pope John Paul II created Schönborn a cardinal-priest in 1998. In that same year, he was elected chairman of the Austrian Bishops’ Conference, a position he held for 22 years. During his 30-year tenure as Archbishop of Vienna, vocations plummeted, in line with most of the German-speaking Church. In 1999, four years after he took over as archbishop, the total number of priests numbered 1,554. By 2022, that number had dropped to 1,057. The number of religious collapsed by roughly half, from 1,154 to 650 among male religious, and 1,878 to 964 for female religious, over the same period. Schönborn has served in various curial positions. He is known to be a popular homilist and a prolific writer and giver of conferences, and his books have been translated into many languages. He is fluent in German, French, and Czech and speaks English and Italian. His special interests are philosophy, psychology, Slavic and Byzantine Christianity, and sacred images. The Austrian cardinal is a descendant of the House of Schönborn whose members bear the title of Count and the style of Illustrious Highness. Several members of the Schönborn family held high offices in the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire from the 17th century, including several prince-bishops, cardinals and ecclesiastical prince-electors. Pope Francis, who has viewed Cardinal Schönborn in the past as his favored successor, kept him on as Archbishop of Vienna despite passing the usual retiring age of 75. The cardinal said in April 2023 that he expected to retire after the Synod on Synodality concluded in October 2024, and Pope Francis accepted his resignation on January 22, 2025, the date of his 80th birthday. Christoph Schönborn is a paradoxical figure, with elements to his views that are difficult to reconcile. He has been called a “spiritual son” of Benedict XVI and worked with Joseph Ratzinger on the Catechism of the Catholic Church, with highest honor received from John Paul II, which would seemingly give him impeccable doctrinal credentials. And yet he displays an openness to positions that John Paul II and Benedict XVI would repudiate, such as accepting the possibility of ordaining women deacons, openness to same sex “marriages” in society, and lack of clarity regarding contraception. Eager to please, he appears intent on trying to appease critics of some but not all of the Church’s moral teaching, both within the Church and in secular society, by finding paths of compromise that many find unacceptable. This tendency appears to originate not from ill will but rather an openness to, and empathy for, people’s problems, needs, and concerns, and a priestly willingness to shepherd the faithful in their brokenness, however misplaced his remedies may be. For Schönborn, showing an understanding for the flaws of others must triumph over judging according to strict doctrine — an approach that matches closely with Pope Francis’ attitude to mercy. His dogmatic theology is often expressed in a beautiful way, and he displays an understanding and appreciation for Catholic teaching, and yet he has been the celebrant at blasphemous celebrations of the Mass, and his cathedral in Vienna was periodically the home of morally problematic art shows. His rejection of “norms” regarding who may or may not receive Communion leans toward a rejection of universal moral norms, but he also condemns priestly unchastity. Initially defensive, he has been consistent and firm in trying to eradicate clerical sexual abuse and its cover-up by the hierarchy. Questions have surrounded the state of his health. In 2019, Schönborn suffered from a pulmonary infarction which required further hospitalization and treatment. In April 2020, he underwent surgery for prostate cancer from which he appears to have made a complete recovery. He exhibits physical tremors but to date these are not thought to relate to any particular illness. With his long pastoral and professorial experience, his warm personality, and his administrative capability, it is undoubtable that Christoph Schönborn has had much to offer the Church, even while holding positions that seem to be at odds with each other. Perhaps he is, as one commentator has suggested, “a dialogue-ready pragmatist.”","• Theology/Ideology: Schönborn holds a complex theological stance that balances traditional Catholic doctrine with progressive views, including openness to women's ordination as deacons and same-sex unions.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is characterized by his warm personality and empathetic approach, often seeking compromise and understanding rather than strict adherence to doctrine.  
• Power Base: As the long-serving Archbishop of Vienna and former chairman of the Austrian Bishops’ Conference, he has cultivated significant influence within the Church and its hierarchy.  
• Core Motivation: Schönborn is driven by a desire to shepherd the faithful through compassion and understanding, often prioritizing empathy over doctrinal rigidity.","Cardinal Christoph Schönborn, the long-serving Archbishop of Vienna and former chairman of the Austrian Bishops’ Conference, is known for his ability to balance traditional Catholic doctrine with progressive perspectives, including openness to women's ordination as deacons and same-sex unions.

212,Angelo Scola,"Cardinal Angelo Scola was born to a communist truck-driver father and a devout, practicing Catholic mother. His hometown was Malgrate, a village close to Milan, and he grew up in a small apartment on a farm on the edge of some woods. Scola was the younger of two sons. After studying engineering for two years at a university in Milan, Scola began studying philosophy at the Catholic University of Milan, earning a doctorate in 1967. During this time, he became closely acquainted with Communion and Liberation and its founder, Don Luigi Giussani, who had a great influence on the rest of his life. Ordained a priest in 1970, Scola earned another doctorate at the University of Fribourg in collaboration with the Dominicans there. In the 1970s, he was involved in student movements, continued to participate in Communion and Liberation, and, coming into contact with Joseph Ratzinger, served as editor of the conservative theological journal Communio, while conducting book-length interviews with Henri de Lubac and Hans Urs von Balthasar. In 1982, Scola began teaching at the Pontifical Lateran University and the John Paul II Institute for Studies on Marriage and the Family. From 1986 to 1991, he served a consultor to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith. In 1991, Scola was consecrated a bishop and John Paul II appointed him overseer of the Diocese of Grosseto. For the next four years, he worked to encourage Catholic education in Grosseto, reopening the seminary there and publishing a book for young people. He also established a diocesan mission to Santa Cruz, Bolivia. In 1995, Scola vacated the Diocese of Grosseto in order to serve as full-time rector of the Lateran University and as president of the John Paul II Institute. In 2002, he was appointed patriarch of Venice and elected president of the bishops’ conference of the Triveneta region in Northern Italy. John Paul II made Scola a cardinal the following year. Two years after being appointed Patriarch, Scola founded the Oasis International Foundation to promote mutual understanding and knowledge between Christians and Muslims, particularly focusing on the realities faced by Christian minorities in predominantly Muslim countries. The foundation continues to promote interfaith and intercultural dialogue, with an emphasis on the interaction between the Islamic world and the West. In 2011, Scola was elected president of the Episcopal Conference of Lombardy, and Benedict XVI appointed him archbishop of Milan. During his tenure as archbishop of Milan from 2011 to 2017, the number of priests in the diocese decreased marginally (2,783 in 2013 to 2,648 in 2016). Male religious also slightly declined by 165 from 1,108 over the same period. However, the number of female religious saw their largest drop since 1980, falling by over 1,000 from 6,210 to 4,924. As Patriarch of Venice from 2002 to 2011, priestly vocations remained stable at around 390; the number of male religious fell from 239 to 224, and female religious dropped from 790 to 558. Scola was the bookies’ favorite at the 2013 conclave and reportedly Benedict XVI’s anointed successor. So sure, in fact, were some in the Italian bishops’ conference that he would be elected, that they prematurely issued a statement saying he had won the final ballot. In reality, he was not popular enough at that time for Italian cardinals, who have the most votes, to unite around him. Scola served in Milan until his resignation was accepted on account of age by Pope Francis in 2017. He is the author of many books and more than 120 scholarly articles. As well as his native Italian, he is also proficient in English, French, and some German and Spanish. Angelo Scola’s life has been marked by his fidelity to a personalistic vision of Catholic life and thought. His friendship with Don Luigi Giussani and Communion and Liberation is one example. Another was his close collaboration with John Paul II, especially the Pontiff’s teachings about sexual morality and the human person. Still another is Scola’s rootedness in the Communio school and his friendship with Joseph Ratzinger, later Benedict XVI. He has significant experience both as a professor and scholar, as well as pastorally as archbishops of Venice and Milan, both traditionally papabile sees. His role in founding the Pontifical Council for Promoting the New Evangelization indicates the importance he places on helping non-Christians convert to the Catholic Faith. Given Scola’s significant intellect, his writings and speeches can be dense and, in keeping with the work of Communion and Liberation, overly intellectual and sometimes inaccessible to the common man. During Benedict’s pontificate, he took an optimistic view of the Church’s travails and was skeptical of descriptions of a “Church in crisis.” He also disdains the expression “crisis of the family” and believes there still is a big zest for family life; “we are just living through the period of big choices.” The problem, according to Scola, is not that today’s men and women do not consider families important, but that they do not know how to preserve them. Scola is firmly opposed to gender ideology but has been silent on more recent contentious debates whether they be non-liturgical blessings of same sex unions or restrictions on the old Mass. He has, however, spoken out in defense of Pope Francis, strongly rebuking those who criticise him, and saying Francis has been a “healthy punch in the stomach.” He also supports synodality, although  he has “some fears” about how it will ultimately turn out. He has shown sound orthodoxy regarding other controversial matters, such as the inadmissibility of women to the ministerial priesthood and his opposition to the “culture of death” in all its forms. A critic of secularization, Scola nevertheless has praised an authentic “laïcité,” which ought to foster holiness among the laity in their proper sphere, which is the world. His various comments on the importance of bringing sound ethical and anthropological judgments to bear on civil life bespeak a recognition that true morality, which the Church proclaims in its teaching, is essential for the common good. He has been near the top of the list of papabili for the last two conclaves, and with administrative, pastoral, and spiritual characteristics such as he possesses, it is no surprise. Now an octogenarian, his chances of becoming pope are diminished but not entirely ruled out.","• Theology/Ideology: Scola adheres to a personalistic vision of Catholic thought, influenced by his connections with Communion and Liberation and the teachings of John Paul II.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is seen as an intellectual leader who can articulate complex theological concepts, though his dense writing may alienate some laypersons.  
• Power Base: Scola has a strong support network among conservative cardinals and was previously viewed as Benedict XVI’s preferred successor, positioning him favorably within traditionalist circles.  
• Core Motivation: His primary drive stems from a commitment to promoting Catholic education and interfaith dialogue, particularly in addressing the challenges faced by Christian minorities in predominantly Muslim countries.","Cardinal Angelo Scola is recognized for his personalistic approach to Catholic thought, drawing on the teachings of John Paul II and his involvement with Communion and Liberation, which reflects his commitment to promoting Catholic education and interfaith dialogue.

213,Marcello Semeraro,"Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, the prefect of the Dicastery for the Causes of Saints, is a trusted adviser of Pope Francis known for his writings on theology and ecclesiology and for his close links to homosexual communities for whom he has consistently lobbied. Born on December 22, 1947, in Monteroni di Lecce, Italy, Semeraro received his initial formation at the Pontifical Regional Seminary “Pius XI” of Apulia and completed his theological studies at the Pontifical Lateran University in Rome, where he earned a licentiate and doctorate in sacred theology. He began his ministry teaching dogmatic theology and ecclesiology at various institutions. Throughout his career, Semeraro has held several significant positions within the Catholic Church. He was appointed Bishop of Oria in 1998 and later transferred to the suburbicarian Church of Albano in 2004. In 2013, Pope Francis appointed him as the Apostolic Administrator of the Exarchic Monastery and Territorial Abbacy of Saint Mary of Grottaferrata. One of Semeraro’s notable achievements was his appointment as secretary of the Council of Cardinals in April 2013, tasked with aiding the Pope in the governance of the Universal Church and revising the Apostolic Constitution Pastor Bonus on the Roman Curia. Semeraro has participated in several important Church assemblies. In 2001, Pope John Paul II chose him to be special secretary of a Synod of Bishops on the role of the bishop, and he has participated in every Synod of Bishops under Pope Francis. He has also served on multiple Church commissions and committees, demonstrating his knowledge of various aspects of Church doctrine and governance. In 2020, Pope Francis appointed him as Prefect of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, choosing someone whom he could trust following the resignation of Cardinal Angelo Becciu over allegations of financial corruption. Francis elevated Semeraro to cardinal in November 2020. The Italian cardinal is currently a member of several important dicasteries within the Vatican, including those for Oriental Churches, Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, Communication, and the Doctrine of the Faith. He has also served as a consultant to Italy’s bishops’ conference, and as president of the board of the bishops’ newspaper, Avvenire. Semeraro has made contributions to theological literature, having published numerous books, articles, and dictionary entries on ecclesiology, likely influencing Church thinking on various matters related to the nature and structure of the Church. Cardinal Semeraro has significant ties to homosexual communities and has frequently expressed a position that seeks greater acceptance of homosexual persons within the Church. He has consistently promoted the LGBT cause within the Church. In a 2016 interview, despite Church documents opposing such a position, Semeraro stated he had “no objection” to the legal recognition of civil same-sex unions, as long as they were not equated with marriage. He has called for an “inclusive pastoral care” approach regarding LGBT people in the Church, and has supported studying homosexuality from anthropological, biblical and theological perspectives. He has consistently argued against discrimination against homosexual persons, and promoted rather “closeness, accompaniment, welcome.” In 2018, Semeraro addressed Italy’s National Forum of LGBT Christians, calling for the Church to welcome LGBT Christians first as baptized Christians and siblings in faith, recognizing their dignity as children of God. In the same year, at an LGBT Christian forum, Semeraro praised parents who welcome and reassure their LGBT children as performing a “creative and regenerative act.” In 2020, Semeraro wrote the preface of book titled “Possible Love: Homosexual Persons and Christian Morality,” by Father Aristide Fumagalli. New Ways Ministry, an LGBT Catholic advocacy group, praised Semeraro’s appointment as cardinal in 2020, citing his positive record on LGBT issues. The Italian Catholic website The New Daily Compass said Semeraro had turned his diocese into the Italian capital of the Catholic-gay movement, annually hosting the Forum of Italian LGBT Christians. The cardinal has not spoken publicly about Fiducia Supplicans, but his prior statements and the fact that he was appointed a consultor to the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith in June 2024 means he likely supports the declaration permitting non-liturgical blessings of same-sex couples. He has stressed his opposition to same-sex “marriage,” reiterating Catholic teaching on marriage as an “indissoluble union of a man and a woman, open in itself to the transmission of life.” Cardinal Semeraro is a strong proponent of synodality, seeing it as primarily a style and approach to the life of the Church, rather than just an event or structure. Regarding women’s priesthood, Semeraro quotes Paul VI, stating that the Church is bound to the Scriptures and the male apostolic tradition, despite recognising the fundamental role of women in the Gospel.","• Theology/Ideology: Semeraro advocates for a more inclusive Church that embraces LGBT individuals while maintaining traditional teachings on marriage.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his pastoral sensitivity and ability to engage in dialogue, particularly with marginalized communities.  
• Power Base: As a trusted adviser to Pope Francis and a member of multiple key dicasteries, Semeraro holds significant influence within the Vatican's governance.  
• Core Motivation: His primary motivation appears to be fostering a Church environment characterized by welcome and acceptance for all, especially those historically marginalized.","Cardinal Marcello Semeraro is recognized for his commitment to fostering a more inclusive Church that embraces all individuals while upholding traditional teachings.

214,Crescenzio Sepe,"Cardinal Crescenzio Sepe is a retired senior Vatican official and former Archbishop of Naples known for his pastoral initiatives but whose administrative record came under scrutiny later in his career. Born on June 2, 1943, in Carinaro, Italy, Sepe was ordained priest on March 12, 1967, for the Diocese of Aversa. He then pursued higher education, earning degrees in theology and canon law from the Pontifical Lateran University and philosophy from the University of Rome. Sepe’s early career included teaching theology at the Lateran and Urban Pontifical Universities. He then entered the diplomatic service of the Holy See, serving in Brazil from 1972 to 1975 before being called to the Secretariat of State. His responsibilities grew, and in 1987, he was appointed Assessor for General Affairs in the Secretariat of State. On April 2, 1992, Sepe was named titular Archbishop of Grado and Secretary of the Congregation for the Clergy, receiving episcopal ordination from Pope John Paul II on April 26, 1992. He played a significant role in preparing for the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000, serving as Secretary General of the Central Committee from November 3, 1997. Sepe’s career continued to advance when he was appointed Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples on April 9, 2001. Later that year, on February 21, St. John Paul II created and proclaimed him Cardinal with the title of Dio Padre Misericordioso. A significant change came on May 20, 2006, when Sepe was appointed Archbishop of Naples, a position he held until December 12, 2020. During his tenure in Naples, he was known for his pastoral initiatives, including opening the doors of Naples Cathedral to immigrants and homeless people for a New Year’s Eve lunch in 2016. Cardinal Sepe participated in the conclaves that elected both Pope Benedict XVI in 2005 and Pope Francis in 2013. Throughout his career, he has authored several theological and pastoral publications, demonstrating his commitment to both scholarship and practical ministry. However, the cardinal has also been associated with several controversies and scandals later in his career, primarily related to financial matters and allegations of corruption. In 2010 he became the target of a corruption investigation by Italian authorities, centering around his time as the Prefect of the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples from 2001 to 2006. He was also named in a broader corruption scandal involving prominent politicians and public officials in Italy. Cardinal Sepe maintained his innocence throughout the investigations. Like other Vatican officials facing similar scrutiny, Sepe argued that he was simply following long-standing practices in Vatican financial dealings.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Sepe emphasizes pastoral care and social justice, demonstrated by his initiatives to support marginalized communities.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his charismatic presence and ability to engage with diverse groups, though his administrative record has faced criticism.  
• Power Base: Sepe has a strong network within the Vatican and among Italian clergy, bolstered by his roles in significant ecclesiastical positions and participation in key conclaves.

215,Ernest Simoni Troshani,"Cardinal Ernest Simoni Troshani's life is a remarkable testimony to faith, forgiveness and perseverance having spent eighteen years in jail at the hands of Albanian communists, during which time he endured torture and harsh conditions that continued even after his release. Born on October 18, 1928, in Troshani, Albania, at the age of ten he entered the Franciscan College in Troshani to begin his formation for the priesthood. However, his path was disrupted in 1948 when the communist regime of Enver Hoxha began its persecution of religious institutions in the country. Despite the challenges, Simoni continued his theological studies clandestinely and was ordained priest on April 7, 1956, in Shkodrë. His ministry was marked by dedication and courage, even in the face of growing oppression. On Christmas Eve 1963, after celebrating Mass, Simoni was arrested and imprisoned. He was initially sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to twenty-five years of hard labor. During his eighteen years of imprisonment, Simoni endured torture and harsh conditions, including work in mines and sewage canals. Despite these hardships, he remained steadfast in his faith, secretly celebrating Mass from memory and hearing confessions of fellow prisoners. After his release in 1981, he was still considered an 'enemy of the people' and was forced to work in the Shkodrë sewers, but he continued to exercise his priestly ministry clandestinely until the fall of the communist regime in 1990. Simoni's extraordinary witness to faith caught the attention of Pope Francis during his visit to Albania in 2014 and on November 19, 2016, he elevated Simoni to the rank of cardinal, assigning him the titular church of Santa Maria della Scala. The appointment was also symbolic, honoring the suffering of Albanian Catholics under communism and promoting their courageous witness to the wider Catholic world. Throughout his life, Cardinal Simoni has been a testament to forgiveness and perseverance. He never used words of hate or resentment towards his jailers, believing that 'only love conquers.'' Now in his 90s, Cardinal Simoni continues to share his powerful testimony with communities around the world, reminding people of the strength of faith in the face of adversity.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Simoni emphasizes a theology of forgiveness and love, shaped by his personal experiences of suffering under a repressive regime.

216,Berhaneyesus Demerew Souraphiel,"Cardinal Berhaneyesus Demerew Souraphiel, the Metropolitan Archbishop of Addis Ababa, is a prominent conservative leader of the Ethiopian Catholic Church who has spoken out strongly on a variety of social and moral issues but faced criticism for his positions on the Tigray War. Born on July 14, 1948, in Tchela Claka, near Harar in eastern Ethiopia, he comes from a family with deep Catholic roots. He was educated in schools run by the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, the Capuchins and the De La Salle Brothers before entering the minor seminary of the Congregation of the Mission (known as “Lazarists” or “Vincentians”) in 1963. He studied at the Makanissa Major Seminary beginning in 1968 and later studied theology at King’s College London. He was ordained priest on July 4, 1976, and soon faced significant challenges. During the communist military regime in Ethiopia, Souraphiel was imprisoned for seven months (1979-1980) in Jimma as part of a crackdown on religious leaders by the Mengistu Haile Mariam military junta. The regime killed many thousands of its opponents, imprisoned people on religious grounds and confiscated property. This experience, however, did not deter Souraphiel’s commitment to his faith and his people. After his release from prison, he moved to Rome where he worked for the Lazarists and studied social sciences at the Pontifical Gregorian University. On returning to Ethiopia in 1983, he served as director of the Lazarist Novitiate in addition to being a parish priest. He also became provincial superior of the Lazarists in Addis Ababa and, after the junta was overthrown in 1991 and Ethiopians were free to practice religion, he taught at the seminary there. Souraphiel’s ecclesiastical career then advanced rapidly. He was appointed prefect of the Apostolic Vicariate of Jimma-Bonga in 1994, auxiliary bishop of Addis Ababa in 1997, and finally, Archbishop of Addis Ababa in 1999. In this role, he also became the head of the Ethiopian Catholic Church, an Eastern Catholic Church in full communion with the Holy See. His leadership also extends beyond Ethiopia. He served as the president of the Catholic bishops’ conference of Ethiopia and Eritrea, and in 2014, he was elected chairman of AMECEA, the Association of Member Episcopal Conferences in Eastern Africa. As president of the bishops’ conference, he participated in the 2014 and 2015 Synods on the Family. In 2015, Pope Francis elevated Souraphiel to the rank of cardinal, recognizing his significant contributions to the Church and his region. One of Cardinal Souraphiel’s most notable achievements has been his strong advocacy for education. In 2005, he established the Ethiopian Catholic University of St. Thomas Aquinas, emphasizing the importance of education in fostering love for one’s country and creating opportunities within Ethiopia. The cardinal considers poverty alleviation one of the most pressing issues facing his region, and recognizes that poverty is a significant challenge in Ethiopia and broader East Africa. He strongly believes in education as a crucial tool for combating poverty and fostering development. He also recognizes the need for improved infrastructure in health and development as crucial for addressing material deficiency in the region. The cardinal has been outspoken on various social and moral issues. He has drawn attention to the problem of human trafficking in Ethiopia, particularly the exploitation of children and women. In 2008, he joined other Ethiopian religious leaders in calling for the criminalization of homosexual activity in the country’s constitution, referring to it as “an infestation.” In 2014, AMECEA issued a statement saying, “we strongly condemn same-sex unions and other deviations that go against human nature and natural laws.” Souraphiel was the association’s head at the time. He has not commented on Fiducia Supplicans but given his positions, and like many of his African confreres, he is likely to be firmly opposed to the declaration. Cardinal Souraphiel has long shown concern for environmental issues. In 2009, he was among the Ethiopian religious leaders who wrote to U.S. President Barack Obama before international climate talks in Denmark. They urged the adoption of a strong “position and full pledge on sound climate change policy,” calling it a “moral and ethical imperative to ensure a preserved environment.” The Ethiopian cardinal faced significant criticism and controversy related to his stance and actions during the 2020-2022 Tigray conflict in Ethiopia. Tigrayan Catholics accused him of being too close to the Ethiopian government’s military actions against Tigray which were labelled a genocide. They also wrote to Pope Francis expressing their concerns about Cardinal Souraphiel’s involvement in the war. In 2022, the cardinal drew criticism for saying the situation was being worsened by a drought brought on by “climate change” rather than the war. He also rejected calling Ethiopia’s military operation in Tigray a conflict or war; Tigrayan priests criticized the cardinal saying he was “trying to protect the image of the country [Ethiopia].” Rather than directly addressing his previous statements, Cardinal Souraphiel shifted his focus to addressing the Church’s role in providing humanitarian assistance and promoting peace. He also highlighted the need for education, vocational training, and economic development to address the root causes of conflict and prevent youth migration. Cardinal Souraphiel speaks Amharic (the official language of Ethiopia), English, and Italian.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Souraphiel is a conservative leader within the Ethiopian Catholic Church, advocating for traditional moral values and social issues while facing scrutiny for his views on the Tigray War.

217,Jaime Spengler,"Cardinal Jaime Spengler, the Archbishop of Porto Alegre, Brazil, is a progressive-leaning Franciscan prelate who has expressed openness to the idea of ordaining married men as priests and responded positively to Fiducia Supplicans, the 2023 declaration on same sex blessings. Born of German descent on September 6, 1960, in Gaspar, Santa Catarina, Brazil, Spengler joined the Order of Friars Minor, taking his first vows in 1983 and his solemn vows in 1985. He was ordained priest on November 17, 1990. Spengler’s academic background includes a doctorate in philosophy at the Pontificul University Antonianum in Rome. In the Franciscan Province of the Immaculate Conception of Brazil, he served as professor in the Franciscan Novitiate at Rodeio, master of postulants (1990), and a variety of other diocesan roles from 1991 to 2010, including parish vicar, professor and vice rector, and vice president of a Franciscan association. On November 10, 2010, he was appointed titular Bishop of Patara and Auxiliary Bishop of Porto Alegre by Pope Benedict XVI and was consecrated the following February. Three years later, on September 18, 2013, Pope Francis appointed Spengler Metropolitan Archbishop of Porto Alegre. Spengler has also been appointed to several important roles within the Church hierarchy. He was elected president of the Brazilian Bishops’ Conference (CNBB) in April 2023 and, shortly after, became President of the Latin American Episcopal Council (CELAM) for a four-year term until 2027. Pope Francis elevated Spengler to the cardinalate on December 7, 2024. Spengler has been involved in some controversial discussions within the Church. He has expressed openness to the idea of ordaining married men as priests to address the shortage of clergy in certain regions, particularly in the Amazon. Spengler stated that the issue is “delicate” but emphasized the need for “frankness and openness” in addressing it. He has also confirmed plans for a trial run of an Amazonian rite of the Mass, which aims to incorporate local cultural elements into the liturgy. Spengler appears to be a strong proponent of synodality. He has described the Synod on Synodality as “an opportunity to rescue the main lines of the Second Vatican Council” and emphasized the importance of implementing the Council Fathers’ intuitions. He encourages bishops not to fear controversies, viewing them as part of the synodal process. The cardinal also seemed approving of Fiducia Supplicans: “I ask a very simple question, which guides me and also guides my actions: are they people? If they are people, they deserve our respect too,” he said. “And when they come to us asking for a blessing, I imagine that they are also looking for a word of comfort, of hope and perhaps even the desire to cope with their own situation. We can’t deny that!” He added: “But we also can’t agree, so to speak, with behavior that goes against what for us are fundamental values: respect for others, respect for one’s own body, respect for one’s own individuality.” Cardinal Spengler is known to take a cautious and diplomatic approach to controversial issues, focusing on unity and dialogue within the Church rather than making definitive statements on divisive topics.","• Theology/Ideology: Spengler advocates for progressive reforms within the Church, including the ordination of married men and the incorporation of local cultural elements into liturgy.

218,James Francis Stafford,"Cardinal James Francis Stafford is a former Major Penitentiary of the Apostolic Penitentiary and Archbishop Emeritus of Denver who has dedicated himself to the causes of ecumenism, marriage, family life, and social justice. Born on July 26, 1932, in Baltimore, Maryland, Stafford has a long and distinguished career in the Church. The only child of Francis Emmett and Mary Dorothy Stafford, he initially aspired to a career in medicine but shifted his focus to the priesthood following the tragic death of a friend in 1952. Stafford attended Loyola College in Baltimore and then St. Mary’s Seminary before being sent to the Pontifical North American College in Rome by Archbishop Francis Keough. He was ordained priest on December 15, 1957. After serving as a parish priest in Baltimore, Stafford pursued further studies at the Catholic University of America, earning a master’s degree in community organization and social work. He also studied at Rutgers University and the University of Wisconsin. In 1964, he became assistant director and later director of Associated Catholic Charities in Baltimore, where he played a significant role in inner-city programs and reorganizing the archdiocese’s services. Stafford was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Baltimore on February 29, 1976, and served as urban vicar for the city. His tenure in Baltimore included involvement in numerous ecclesial and civic organizations. In 1982, he was named Bishop of Memphis, Tennessee, where he opposed racism and advocated for workers’ rights. In 1986, he became Archbishop of Denver, Colorado, where he organized the first World Youth Day in 1993 during Pope John Paul II’s visit.

219,Leonardo Ulrich Steiner,"Cardinal Leonardo Ulrich Steiner, the Metropolitan Archbishop of Manaus, is a staunchly progressive prelate, a defender of the poor and the environment who supports ordaining women as deacons and normalizing homosexuality in the Church. Born on November 6, 1950, in Forquilhinha, Santa Catarina, Brazil, of German ancestry, Steiner joined the Order of Friars Minor in 1976 and was ordained priest on January 21, 1978. He pursued his education in philosophy and theology, obtaining a bachelor’s degree in philosophy and pedagogy from the Salesian Faculty of Lorraine, as well as a licentiate and doctorate in philosophy from the Pontifical Antonianum University in Rome. Throughout his career, Steiner has held various significant teaching positions within the Church. He served as a seminary formator until 1986 and as a novice master from 1986 to 1995. From 1995 to 2003, he was a professor of philosophy and secretary at the Pontifical University Antonianum in Rome. Upon returning to Brazil in 2003, he worked as an assistant pastor and lecturer in philosophy. Steiner’s episcopal journey began on February 2, 2005, when Pope John Paul II appointed him as the bishop prelate of São Félix. He later served as an auxiliary bishop of Brasília from 2011 to 2019. From May 2011 to May 2019, he held the position of Secretary General of the Episcopal Conference of Brazil. On November 27, 2019, Pope Francis appointed him as the Archbishop of Manaus, a role he assumed on January 31, 2020. Manaus is one of two cities located in the Amazon Rainforest. A significant milestone in Steiner’s career came on August 27, 2022, when Pope Francis elevated him to the rank of cardinal, making him the first cardinal from the Amazon region. He was given the titular church of St. Leonard of Port Maurice in Acilia. Steiner is well known for his progressive stance on various social and environmental issues. In 2014, while auxiliary bishop of Brasilia, he broke with previous Vatican teaching documents, but echoed the views of Pope Francis, by endorsing civil unions for same-gender couples, stating that such couples “need legal protection in society” in addition to support from the Church. Cardinal Steiner is a strong believer in climate change theory and is greatly concerned about its possible impact, particularly in relation to the Amazon region and indigenous communities. He directly links deforestation to climate change, pointing out the severe drought that has affected indigenous communities in his diocese of Manaus. He has criticized the consumerist and mercantile mentality driving deforestation, saying it “has to change.” He advocates learning from indigenous communities’ sustainable practices, noting that they “don’t consume extraordinarily, they consume what they need to live and to live together.” Steiner is a firm supporter of synodality, stating that before the Synod on Synodality, the Church was on a mission, but “now we are synodal Church on a mission.” He believes the Amazon Synod of 2019 opened up the “experience of synodality” and “the participation of everyone.” Speaking to reporters during the October 2024 assembly, he said he wished “that some more distant communities [in the Amazon] could celebrate some sacraments, for example baptism, without the presence of a priest.” He continued by saying that “many of our women are true ‘deaconesses’ without this being official” and emphasized that he was in favor of the ordination of women to the diaconate. Steiner is also a strong advocate of a married clergy, and pointed out that Pope Francis “has not closed the question” of the ordination of married men. He expressed his hope that Francis “has the capacity to move forward” on the issue.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Steiner is a progressive theologian advocating for the ordination of women as deacons and the normalization of same-sex civil unions within the Church.

220,Beniamino Stella,"Cardinal Beniamino Stella is a progressive retired Vatican diplomat who served as prefect of the Dicastery for Clergy during Pope Francis’ pontificate, overseeing the creation of updated guidelines on the formation of priests. Born on August 18, 1941, in Pieve di Soligo, Treviso, Italy, Stella was one of twelve siblings in his family. His journey in the Church began with his ordination as priest on March 19, 1966, after completing his studies at the Vittorio Veneto Seminary and the Pontifical Roman Seminary. Stella’s education includes a degree in canon law from the Pontifical Lateran University and a doctorate in international law from the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. His career in the Church has been marked by numerous significant appointments and roles. In 1970, he began his diplomatic service at the apostolic nunciature in Santo Domingo, followed by a posting in Zaire (now Democratic Republic of Congo) in 1973. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Stella held various positions within the Vatican, including work at the Council for the Public Affairs of the Church and as charge d’affaires at the apostolic nunciature in Malta. On August 21, 1987, he was appointed titular archbishop of Midila and apostolic nuncio to the Central-African Republic, Congo Brazzaville, and Chad, receiving his episcopal ordination on September 5, 1987. Stella’s diplomatic career continued with appointments as apostolic nuncio to Cuba in 1992 and to Colombia in 1999. In 2007, Pope Benedict XVI called him to Rome to serve as president of the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy. A significant milestone in Stella’s career came on September 21, 2013, when Pope Francis appointed him prefect of the Congregation for the Clergy and elevated to the cardinalate. In February 2014. As prefect of the then-Congregation for Clergy, Cardinal Stella oversaw the development of the new Ratio Fundamentalis Institutionis Sacerdotalis guidelines for priestly formation, which had not been revised since 1985. Stella favors restrictions on the Traditional Latin Mass and was involved in the implementation of Traditionis Custodes. As dicastery prefect, he forbade priests in his dicastery to wear cassocks instead of priest suits. In a sign of personal favor, in May 2020 Pope Francis promoted Cardinal Stella to the Order of Bishops, assigning him the title of the Suburbicarian Church of Porto-Santa Rufina.

221,Daniel Fernando Sturla,"Salesian Cardinal Daniel Fernando Sturla Berhouet is a Ratzingerian Latin American archbishop whose battles to defend the faith have been tried by Uruguay’s long and steady descent into secularism.    Born on July 4, 1959 in Montevideo (Eastern Republic of Uruguay), he is the youngest of five siblings. His father was a lawyer who died in 1972 when he was thirteen years old; his mother, who stayed at home, died just three years later. Both were Catholics. The death of his parents forced his older siblings to work to maintain the home. He studied until the fourth year of high school at the Colegio San Juan Bautista, in Montevideo, completing his baccalaureate (the last two years of high school) at the nearby Salesian college preparatory Institute Juan XXIII. He went on to earn a Bachelor of Law and later the Bachelor of Theology at the Theological Institute of Uruguay. Sturla professed religious vows with the Salesians on January 31, 1980, and then continued his studies in philosophy and educational sciences at the Miguel Rúa Institute run by the congregation. He worked at the Don Bosco Workshops from 1982 to 1983, and from 1984 to 1987 continued his studies in theology at the Monsignor Mariano Soler University Institute (former Faculty of Theology of Uruguay) belonging to the archdiocese of Montevideo. He was ordained to the priesthood on November 21, 1987 and entrusted with various roles — counsellor for studies of Talleres Don Bosco, vicar of the Salesian novitiate, master of novices, and director of the John XXIII Pre-University Institute — while he continued his theological studies. In 2008, he was appointed provincial of the Salesian Province of Uruguay, a position he held until 2011. Sturla is a professor of Church History in Uruguay at the Faculty of Theology Monsignor Mariano Soler and has written several articles on the subject.1 His whole life and priestly ministry, which has been characterized by his concern to care for the weakest and for the accompaniment of young people in their personal and spiritual development, has been spent in the Uruguayan capital. Sturla rose quickly through the ecclesiastical ranks. In December 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him auxiliary of the archdiocese of Montevideo. He was consecrated in the metropolitan cathedral in March 2012, taking the motto: Servite Domino in laetitia – serve the Lord with joy. Less than two years later, Pope Francis named him Archbishop of Montevideo, granting him the pallium later that year (June 2014) in St Peter’s Basilica. And within one year (February 14, 2015), he was created a cardinal. Soon thereafter, Sturla was appointed to several Vatican dicasteries, including the Dicasteries for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, and for Evangelization. In September 2015, he was also named a member of the Pontifical Commission for Latin America. In March 2020,  he was appointed a member of the Commission of Cardinals for the Administration of the Apostolic Patrimony (APSA), and three months later he was named a member of the Dicastery for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. Challenges for the Church in Uruguay The region that currently constitutes the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, where Cardinal Sturla was born and lived his priestly life, was evangelized by Spanish religious missionaries, mainly Jesuits and Franciscans, more than a century after the arrival of Christopher Columbus in America. Its decline into secularism is a long and complex one. As Cardinal Sturla himself defines it, the Catholic Church in Uruguay: “…had a weakness of origin. It was not until 1878 that the Eastern Church was constituted as such when the first diocese was created, that of Montevideo, with Monsignor Jacinto Vera as its first Bishop. In the meantime, the long secularization process had already begun. […] Colonial Christianity, so strong in other countries of America, was not consolidated on our soil. The flood of immigrants, which multiplied the population of the country by fourteen in less than a century (1830-1900), found a Church in formation, which was fought against and often ‘ignored.’” As the Church was carrying out a monumental work of evangelization, a process of gradual and incessant de-Christianization of the social, cultural and political life of the national community had begun. Initiated in 1859, the movement was promoted by rationalist and Masonic forces under the protection of British power, which sought to maintain Uruguay as a balancing power between Brazil and Argentina and, at the same time, as a secular society stripped of all public religious presence. By the end of the nineteenth and beginning of the twentieth century, this process became increasingly violent, anti-clerical and anti-Christian.2 This anti-Christian, secularizing sentiment has been at work to the present day, such that, in 2014, Sturla stood firm in the face of attempts by Montevideo legislators to block a statue of the Virgin Mary from being erected in a public space in the city, where believers had begun to gather to pray the family Rosary. Sturla intervened on several occasions, with an unshakable yet serene, non-confrontational style that those who know him say has characterized his episcopal work. Sturla’s Approach Cardinal Sturla is orthodox in his beliefs. Christ and the Eucharist must be at the center, and the Church’s teaching should be vigorously defended in the face of secularism. He has a distinctly Ratzingerian vision for the Church and especially when it comes to the Second Vatican Council which he sees as being in continuity with the past rather than a “rupture.” The Church, Sturla firmly believes, is “salt of the earth and light of the world” and must be “the bridge through which each person can encounter the Lord.” He is keen to shore up the Church’s identity and to avoid diluting it by “falling into the trap of self-secularization.” The diversity of charisms within the Church must be respected, he says, while she must also insert herself “into popular environments still far from her.”3 He sees it as imperative that the Church “reach out to everyone,” but “without denying her own identity.” The Church is open to all, he says, “but with certain rules.” Sturla agrees with Francis that evangelization is threatened by “incorporeal neo-Gnosticism and individualist neo-Pelagianism,” but he also believes that mission must focus on proclaiming Jesus Christ as Savior, otherwise the Church will merely be “like a giant NGO that seeks a better world with others.” The Church in Uruguay, he says, must safeguard the faith in the face of this danger of self-secularization, keeping alive sacramentally the presence of the Risen Lord. He is no fan of synodality, upholds the Church’s teaching on life, and rejects Fiducia Supplicans. When it comes to pastoral conversion, Sturla sees an urgency to recover the faith, retrieve a sense of original sin, and restore the Church’s integral sense of salvation, along with proclaiming the joy of the Gospel. A bishop, he believes, must be creatively faithful to divine Revelation. With his conservative and orthodox beliefs, a Sturla pontificate would almost certainly mark the return of a Ratzingerian or Wojtijan direction and in doing so put the Barque of Peter back on a more even keel. The principal question he faces, however, is whether the cardinal electors would want to risk a second Latin American pope so soon after the turmoil of the first.","• Theology/Ideology: Sturla is a Ratzingerian theologian who emphasizes the importance of Christ and the Eucharist at the center of Church life while defending traditional teachings against secularism.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his unshakable yet serene and non-confrontational style, Sturla effectively navigates complex situations while maintaining his orthodox beliefs.

Born on January 30, 1939, in Celaya, Mexico, Suárez Inda began his religious education at the seminary in Morelia before furthering his studies at the Latin American Pontifical Pius College in Rome from 1958 to 1965. Ordained priest on August 8, 1964, Suárez Inda initially served as a parish vicar in Morelia and Pátzcuaro. He then taught at the archdiocesan seminary and later became the first parish priest of the Assumption of Mary community in his hometown of Celaya. In 1974, he was appointed rector of the minor seminary in the newly created diocese of Celaya, a position he held until 1985. Suárez Inda’s episcopal journey began on November 5, 1985, when he was appointed Bishop of Tacámbaro, receiving his episcopal ordination the following month. His leadership skills were further recognized when Pope John Paul II appointed him Archbishop of Morelia on January 20, 1995. During his two decades as Archbishop of Morelia, Suárez Inda made significant contributions to the growth of the Church in the region. He oversaw the creation of the new diocese of Irapuato, established over 40 new parishes, and ordained four bishops and approximately 300 priests. His tenure in Morelia was marked by challenges, including addressing the scourge of drug trafficking, which Pope Francis strongly denounced in the area. Suárez Inda has been an active member of the Bishops’ Conference of Mexico (CEM), serving in various capacities including vice-president for two terms. He has also been involved with the Latin American Episcopal Council (CELAM) and participated in several important Church assemblies and conferences.

223,Ignatius Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo,"Cardinal Ignatius Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo, the Archbishop of Jakarta and Military Ordinary for Indonesia, is a fervent advocate for social justice, environmental awareness, and interfaith dialogue. Born on July 9, 1950, in Sedayu, Indonesia, he grew up in a family of 10 children with strong religious vocations, with one brother becoming a monk and two sisters becoming nuns. Suharyo pursued his religious education diligently, entering the minor seminary at age 11 and later completing his studies in philosophy and theology. He obtained his licentiate and doctorate from the Pontifical Urban University in Rome in 1979 and 1981, respectively. He was ordained priest on January 26, 1976, and served as a formator and professor at various institutions, including the Sanata Dharma Jesuit university where he was head of the department of philosophy and sociology. In this period, he shared in the sufferings of a population suffering from the country’s dictatorship. In 1997, Pope John Paul II appointed him Archbishop of Semarang, the first of several significant positions he has been given in the Indonesian Catholic Church. For three years, until 2000, he led the Commission for Interreligious Dialogue within the Indonesian Episcopal Conference (Kwi). He then served as secretary general of the bishop’s conference from 2000 to 2006, and was appointed Military Ordinary for Indonesia in 2006. In 2009, he became the Coadjutor Archbishop of Jakarta and succeeded as Archbishop in 2010. He was also vice president of the bishops’ conference until 2012. In recognition of his service and leadership, Pope Francis elevated Suharyo to the rank of cardinal on October 5, 2019, making him the third cardinal from Indonesia. He currently serves as a member of the Dicastery for Evangelization and the Dicastery for Inter-religious Dialogue. One of Suharyo’s notable achievements was the establishment of a Catholic justice and peace commission in Jakarta in 2016. This commission aims to address problems faced by marginalized groups in Indonesia’s capital city. He has been an advocate for social justice, environmental awareness, and interfaith dialogue in Indonesia. Suharyo has been vocal about various social issues in Indonesia. He has spoken out against corruption, violence, and environmental damage, particularly highlighting the country’s plastic waste problem. He has also addressed human rights concerns, calling for the government to address past abuses and emphasizing the importance of respecting human dignity. In common with Pope Francis, the cardinal has promoted inclusive actions regarding homosexuals and transgender people, instructing clergy to welcome them into parishes as part of a push to respect human dignity. Cardinal Suharyo sees liturgical celebrations, especially the Eucharist, as important community-building events. He has spoken about basic communities gathering for prayer and exploring themes of solidarity and subsidiarity through their liturgical life. The cardinal has consistently emphasized the importance of peaceful coexistence and collaboration between different religious communities in Indonesia, the world’s largest Muslim-majority country. He has even gone so far as to highlight the symbolic significance of the Istiqlal Mosque (the national mosque) being intentionally built near the Catholic cathedral in Jakarta, seeing it as a symbol of religious harmony. He also noted positively the significance of an underground tunnel connecting the mosque and the cathedral, known as the “Tunnel of Friendship.” He has said this physical connection symbolizes the desire for interfaith understanding and cooperation. During Pope Francis’ visit to Jakarta in September 2024, the Pope and Indonesian Grand Imam Nasaruddin Umar signed a joint declaration at the mosque, calling on religious leaders to deepen their cooperation in order to defend human dignity and fight climate change. The cardinal noted that the Grand Imam of the Istiqlal Mosque was among the first to announce Pope Francis’s visit to Indonesia, even before the Vatican’s formal announcement. This gesture was seen as a sign of openness and enthusiasm for interfaith dialogue. During the Pope’s visit, Cardinal Suharyo served as an important bridge between Pope Francis, the local Catholic community, and Indonesian society at large, helping to interpret and amplify the Pope’s message of interfaith harmony and social justice.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Suharyo champions social justice, environmental stewardship, and interfaith dialogue, reflecting a commitment to inclusivity and human dignity.

224,Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle,"Luis Antonio Gokim Tagle’s paternal grandfather was from an upperclass Filipino family, and his maternal grandmother was from a well-off Chinese family that immigrated to the Philippines. One of two children, he often goes by his nickname, “Chito.” Originally preparing to become a physician, Chito was somewhat “tricked” into considering seminary, which later led him to laugh about how the “jokes” of God and others can influence one’s life. Jesuits have played an important role in his formation, having taught him in the San José Seminary and then at the Ateneo de Manila University, where he earned a bachelor’s degree in 1977 and then a master of arts. Leaving the Jesuits, he was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Manila in 1982. Immediately, he became the spiritual director and professor at the local seminary, and then its rector from 1983 to 1985. Sent to the United States by his bishop, he earned a license in theology in 1987 and then a doctorate in 1991 on the topic of episcopal collegiality in the praxis and doctrine of Paul VI, under the theologian Joseph Komonchak. This opened the door for Tagle to become a prominent proponent of the “Bologna School” of ecclesiology and historiography, which views the Second Vatican Council as a rupture from the pre-conciliar period. For fifteen subsequent years, he sat on the editorial board of the History of Vatican II historical research project, overseen by Giuseppe Alberigo. Returning to the Philippines, Tagle served as Episcopal Vicar for Religious from 1993 to 1995 and as pastor of the cathedral parish in Imus from 1998 to 2001. In 2001, John Paul II appointed Tagle bishop of the Imus Diocese, where he served until Benedict nominated him archbishop of Manila in 2011. His theological apostolate has included serving as a member of the International Theological Commission from 1997 until 2003. He has also participated in the Federation of Asian Episcopal Conferences. Benedict XVI created Tagle a cardinal in 2012, after which time he has served on many councils and in many congregations. Tagle participated in recent Synods of Bishops in Rome — on the New Evangelization in 2012, on the family in 2014 and 2015, on youth in 2018, and on the Amazon in 2019. In 2015, Cardinal Tagle became president of Caritas Internationalis and was reelected for another four-year term in 2019. In November 2022, Pope Francis “swept away the leadership of Caritas Internationalis, including Cardinal Tagle,” as one outlet put it. In 2019, Pope Francis called Tagle to reside in Rome as prefect of the prestigious Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples. After the congregation’s restructuring, it was announced that Tagle would now be pro-prefect of the Dicastery for Evangelization.  In 2020, the Pope elevated Tagle to the rank of cardinal-bishop, possibly signifying the Filipino cardinal as a favored successor at that time. Touted as the “Asian Francis,” Cardinal Tagle possesses not only attributes similar to Jorge Bergoglio and extensive pastoral and administrative experience but also significant theological and historical training. Indeed at one time he was considered to be Pope Francis’ preferred successor but has since fallen out of favor. Unafraid to share his emotions and sentimentality in public, even seemingly eager to do so, he often displays a playful side, as when dancing with youth, or in the sanctuary, or celebrating Mass in a folksy and casual manner. Nevertheless, Tagle is known as a shrewd negotiator, and he employs political tactics with sophistication. His tutelage under the Jesuits in the Philippines and his graduate studies in the United States, subsequent fifteen years of work with Joseph Komonchak and Giuseppe Alberigo, and connections with the “Bologna School,” firmly root him more in the camp of those with a progressive ecclesiological vision — although he himself prefers to eschew such labels. Tagle often uses the pulpit to respond to issues of social justice, but his positions on moral matters appear somewhat incoherent. On the one hand, he railed against a Filipino “Reproductive Health” bill, albeit less strongly than some of his fellow bishops, that introduced anti-family and anti-life policies, and he has spoken strongly against abortion and euthanasia. On the other hand, he holds that some situations exist where universal moral principles do not apply, as in the case of Communion for couples who live together conjugally but without sacramental marriage, and issues relating to homosexuality. He opposes use of “harsh” or “severe” language when describing certain sins and believes the Church needs to “learn over” its teaching of mercy due in part to the “shifts in cultural and social sensibilities.” In short, he downplays the gravity of such sins and the public scandal that they give. But when it comes to popular causes, Cardinal Tagle has shown himself to be a clear and vocal advocate. This is especially true of issues such as ecology, seen in his active participation in the controversial Pachamama ritual in the Vatican Gardens in 2019. Along with his ambiguous statements about the goodness of all religions, these factors raise questions about what Tagle believes to be the essence of the gospel. In May 2025, the Italian Catholic daily La Nuova Bussola Quotidiana reported that at least 5 sources, including three from Macao, have testified that Cardinal Tagle “regularly plays in Macao casinos through a proxy or an avatar who makes the bets for him.” The newspaper went on to say that “whether it is a gambling addiction or something else is not known, but it is certain that Tagle is part of a network of billionaires who all have something to do with the development of casinos in the Pacific.” His appointment as prefect of the Congregration for the Evangelization of Peoples and elevation to the rank of cardinal-bishop nevertheless place Tagle in a favorable position for the papacy if voting cardinals desire continuity with Francis’ pontificate and wish for another pope from the global south. However, at just 67 his relative youth is also a factor likely to lessen his chances of election. Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle is known for his linguistic abilities. As well as his native Tagalog, he is fluent in English and Italian and has a knowledge of French, Korean, Chinese and Latin.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Tagle is a prominent proponent of progressive ecclesiology, influenced by the ""Bologna School,"" which emphasizes the significance of the Second Vatican Council as a transformative period in Church history.

225,Sigitas Tamkevičius,"Hounded, persecuted and imprisoned by communists for many years, Cardinal Sigitas Tamkevičius is a Lithuanian Jesuit whose life story is intertwined with the struggle for religious freedom under Soviet occupation. Born on November 7, 1938, in Krikstonys, Lithuania, Tamkevičius grew up during a tumultuous period in his country’s history. After completing his secondary education in Seirijai in 1955, Tamkevičius entered the seminary of Kaunas to pursue his religious calling. He was ordained priest on April 18, 1962, by Bishop Petras Maželis. In the years that followed, he served as a vicar in various parishes across Lithuania. In 1968, Tamkevičius secretly joined the Society of Jesus at a time when religious orders were prohibited under Soviet law. His decision marked the beginning of his active resistance against the oppressive regime. In 1972, while serving as a vicar in Simnas, he initiated the clandestine publication of the Chronicle of the Catholic Church of Lithuania. This underground journal documented and exposed the religious discrimination faced by Catholics in Soviet Lithuania. Tamkevičius’s commitment to defending religious rights intensified in 1978 when he co-founded the Catholic Committee for the Defence of Believers’ Rights. This group played a crucial role in revealing the truth about religious persecution behind the Iron Curtain. The Soviet authorities, threatened by Tamkevičius’s activities, arrested him in 1983. He was tried on charges of anti-Soviet propaganda and agitation, resulting in a harsh sentence of ten years in prison and exile. During his imprisonment, Tamkevičius spent time in the infamous KGB prison in Vilnius, where he endured intense interrogations. Following his conviction, Tamkevičius was sent to labor camps in Perm and Mordovia. In 1988, he was exiled to Siberia to complete his sentence. However, the changing political climate under Gorbachev’s perestroika led to his release later that year. Upon returning to Lithuania, Tamkevičius resumed his religious duties with renewed vigor. In 1989, he was appointed spiritual director of the Kaunas Seminary, and in 1990, he became its rector. His dedication and leadership were recognized by Pope John Paul II, who appointed him as auxiliary bishop of Kaunas on May 8, 1991. Tamkevičius’s rise in the Church hierarchy continued, and on May 4, 1996, he was appointed metropolitan archbishop of Kaunas by Pope John Paul II. Throughout his tenure, he held various leadership positions within the Lithuanian Episcopal Conference, including serving as its president for multiple terms. In recognition of his lifelong service and commitment to the Church, Pope Francis elevated Tamkevičius to the rank of Cardinal on October 5, 2019. His appointment came as a surprise to many, including Tamkevičius himself, who viewed it as an acknowledgment of his role as a witness to the faith. Today, Cardinal Tamkevičius continues to be an active and respected figure in the Lithuanian Catholic Church. He connects with people using social media platforms like Facebook to reach out to his community. His life story serves as a powerful testament to the resilience of faith in the face of oppression and the enduring spirit of those who fought for religious freedom in Lithuania.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Sigitas Tamkevičius embodies a deep commitment to religious freedom and social justice, shaped by his experiences under Soviet oppression.

226,Orani Joāo Tempesta,"Cardinal Orani João Tempesta, the Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro, is a Cistercian monk who, like many other cardinals chosen by Pope Francis, has a strong commitment to social justice issues — a reputation that has earned Tempesta the nickname of a “worker bishop.” Born on June 23, 1950, in São José do Rio Pardo, Brazil, Tempesta entered the Cistercian monastery of São Bernardo in 1967 after completing his high school studies. He then studied philosophy at the monastery of São Bento in São Paulo and theology at the Pius IX Salesian Theological Institute. He took his religious vows in the Order of the Cistercians in 1969, and was ordained priest on December 7, 1974. His ecclesiastical career progressed rapidly. In 1984, he became prior of his monastery while also serving as a parish priest and coordinator of communications and diocesan pastoral works. In 1996, when the monastery of São Bernardo was elevated to the status of an abbey, Tempesta was elected as its first abbot. On February 26, 1997, Tempesta was appointed Bishop of São José do Rio Preto. He later served as Archbishop of Belém do Pará from 2004 to 2009 before being named Archbishop of Rio de Janeiro by Pope Benedict XVI on February 27, 2009. He served as vice president of the Norte 2 Regional of the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil, president of the National Commission for Culture, Education and Social Communications and full member of the permanent council, the pastoral council and the economic council of the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil. Pope Francis elevated Tempesta to the rank of cardinal on February 22, 2014, assigning him the titular church of Santa Maria Madre della Provvidenza a Monte Verde. As cardinal, he has been appointed to several important Vatican congregations and councils. Tempesta has been actively involved in various social and pastoral initiatives. He participated in the Fifth General Conference of the Bishops of Latin America and the Caribbean in 2007. In 2013, he welcomed Pope Francis to Rio de Janeiro for World Youth Day. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Tempesta was a strong advocate for vaccination, even hosting a vaccination event at the feet of the Christ the Redeemer statue, despite persistent questions over their ethical nature, safety and effectiveness. Throughout his career, Cardinal Tempesta has been known for his communication skills and his commitment to social issues, especially tackling poverty, earning him the nickname of a “worker bishop.” He has spent much of his time in the episcopate showing proximity to his flock and addressing social issues. The cardinal has been a strong advocate for pro-life issues — an aspect that made him for a short time an ally of Brazil’s right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro. In 2007, he debated with the Brazilian health minister about abortion, demonstrating his opposition to the practice. In a famous case involving a young Brazilian girl’s abortion in 2009, he defended the Church’s official position against the dissenting view of Archbishop Rino Fisichella, then president of the Pontifical Academy for Life. The cardinal follows the official position of the Catholic Church, which does not approve of same-sex unions. However, he emphasises the importance of welcoming and respecting all people, regardless of their sexual orientation. As archbishop of a notoriously violent city, in 2016 Cardinal Tempesta had to take shelter behind his car during a gun battle between police and armed bandits while on his way to the airport. Cardinal Tempesta has been committed to using new and social media as means of spreading the Gospel, indicating an openness to modern methods of communication for evangelization. However, he stopped posting on X in May 2022 shortly after Elon Musk bought the company, although it is not clear if that was the reason for the cessation. He still has an X account. Cardinal Tempesta has spoken out in favor of protecting the environment and combating climate change. He supports Pope Francis’ initiatives in this area, including the encyclical Laudato Si’, which addresses the environmental issue. As an active member of the National Conference of Bishops of Brazil (CNBB), Cardinal Tempesta supports the process of synodality promoted by Pope Francis, which seeks greater participation and dialogue within the Church. The Brazilian cardinal has shown concern for the issue of migrants and refugees, aligning himself with Pope Francis’ call to welcome and protect these vulnerable populations. The Archdiocese of Rio de Janeiro, under his leadership, has programmes to support migrants and refugees.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Tempesta is a Cistercian monk with a strong commitment to social justice and pro-life issues, aligned with the Catholic Church's official teachings.

227,Toribio Ticona Porco,"Cardinal Toribio Ticona Porco, the bishop emeritus of Corcoro (Bolivia), comes from the humble beginnings of shining shoes and working in a mine to a life dedicated to helping the poor and the marginalized. Born on April 25, 1937, in Atocha, Bolivia, Ticona Porco grew up in poverty and worked various jobs to support his family, including selling newspapers, shining shoes, and working as a miner. He also served as a bricklayer’s assistant and a mechanic during his youth. Before entering the seminary, Ticona Porco spent 14 years as the mayor of Chacarilla, a small mining municipality, where he would also celebrate Mass for the community on Sundays. His dedication to social justice led to his imprisonment at one point for “defending the cause of the poor.” After his diverse work experiences, Ticona Porco pursued a religious vocation and was eventually ordained a priest at the age of thirty. He rose through the ranks of the Catholic Church, becoming the Bishop of Corocoro, Bolivia. Throughout his ecclesiastical career, he maintained a strong connection with the working class and indigenous communities. In May 2018, at the age of 81, Pope Francis appointed Ticona Porco cardinal, making him the only Bolivian member of the Sacred College at the time. This appointment came as a surprise to Ticona Porco himself, who humbly stated, “I am the son of a miner, I am a campesino, but above all I am a humble person.” Ticona Porco’s relationship with Pope Francis dates back to their encounters during his missionary work with Bolivian immigrants in the slums of Buenos Aires, where Francis was previously the archbishop. The Pope is said to have a particular fondness for Ticona Porco, though the cardinal himself modestly claims not to know the reason. Throughout his life and career, Cardinal Toribio Ticona Porco has remained committed to serving the poor and marginalized, embodying the values of humility and social justice. In addition to Spanish and Quechua, Cardinal Ticona Porco learned all the languages spoken in the Prelature of Corocoro during his time there.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Ticona Porco emphasizes social justice and the importance of serving the poor and marginalized within the Catholic Church.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is characterized by humility and a strong connection to the working class, which fosters trust and relatability among diverse communities.  
• Power Base: His long-standing role in local governance and as a bishop has established him as a respected figure in both ecclesiastical and secular circles in Bolivia.  
• Core Motivation: Driven by his own experiences of poverty, Ticona Porco is motivated by a deep commitment to advocate for the rights and dignity of marginalized populations.","Cardinal Toribio Ticona Porco is a dedicated advocate for social justice, emphasizing the Church's role in serving the poor and marginalized.

228,Joseph William Tobin,"Cardinal Joseph William Tobin, the Metropolitan Archbishop of Newark, is a progressive-thinking prelate who has strongly supported the cause of migrants, advocated for the LGBTQ community, and has a vision for the Church that closely aligns with that of Pope Francis. Joseph Tobin was born on May 3, 1952, in Detroit, Michigan, the oldest of 13 children. He attended Holy Redeemer Elementary School in Detroit and St. Joseph’s Prep College, Edgerton, WI. While at school he felt called to serve as a priest and applied to join the Redemptorists who accepted him as a candidate. He professed vows in 1973 and solemn vows in 1976. As a novice, he continued his education at Holy Redeemer College, Waterford, WI, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy in 1975. From 1977 until 1979, he attended Mount Saint Alphonsus Seminary in Esopus, NY, earning and M.A. in Religious Education in 1977 and Divinity in 1979. Tobin was ordained as a priest in 1978 and quickly rose through the ranks of the Redemptorist order. Between 1979 and 1984, Father Tobin served as associate pastor of Holy Redeemer Parish, Detroit, where he engaged in both pastoral ministry to the Hispanic community and youth ministry. In 1984, he was named pastor of Holy Redeemer Parish. He also served in a number of diocesan assignments within the Archdiocese of Detroit, including: Episcopal Vicar; member of the Presbyteral Council, and; official in the Metropolitan Tribunal. In 1997, he was elected as the Superior General of the Redemptorists, a position he held for two terms until 2009. In 2003, he was also named vice-president of the Union of Superiors General. Tobin served as a member of the Council for Relations between the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life and the International Union of Superiors General from 2001 to 2009. In May 2009, the Vatican named him to oversee the professed men’s element of the 2010 Apostolic Visitation of the Church in Ireland. In 2010, after a short sabbatical in Oxford, England, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Tobin to Secretary of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life and he was consecrated archbishop the same year. In 2012, Tobin was appointed the Archbishop of Indianapolis, where he served until 2016. It is not clear why Benedict chose to appoint him to Indianapolis after just two years in the curia, but it could have had to do with differences he was having with the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith over the handling of a doctrinal assessment of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious (LCWR). The conference was facing questions over its theological orthodoxy.1 During his tenure in Indianapolis, Tobin had a dispute with then-Governor Mike Pence over the resettlement of Syrian refugees, making national headlines. Pence had ordered a stop to efforts to resettle Syrian refugees, a move Tobin called immoral and illegal and said the Indianapolis archdiocese would continue to welcome them. Pope Francis elevated Tobin to the rank of cardinal in November 2016, making him one of the most prominent American Catholic leaders. Shortly after, he was appointed as the Archbishop of Newark, where he continues to serve today. Throughout his ecclesiastical life, Tobin has been known for his advocacy for various social issues. He has been a strong proponent of immigration reform and has publicly supported undocumented immigrants. In 2017, he accompanied an undocumented immigrant to his deportation hearing, demonstrating his commitment to this cause.  He called on Catholic leaders to resist President Trump’s immigration policies during Trump’s first term.2 Cardinal Tobin has been a consistent promoter of LGBTQ interests within the Church. In 2017, he welcomed a “pilgrimage” of gay and lesbian Catholics and their families to the archdiocese’s cathedral, and has spoken about the importance of the Church having “open doors” to welcome all. He also signed a statement supporting LGBTQ youth and opposing discrimination against them. He advocates changing the “intrinsically disordered” reference to homosexuality in the catechism, saying he hopes the language can be “less hurtful.” Tobin also endorsed Father James Martin’s 2017 book Building a Bridge which called on the Church to change her view on homosexuality but which was criticized by orthodox prelates and theologians. The American cardinal expressed support for the Vatican’s 2023 declaration Fiducia Supplicans allowing pastoral blessings for same-sex couples, while emphasizing that the Church’s teaching on marriage remains unchanged. The cardinal has progressive views on women in the Church. He has said women should be able to speak at Mass, have input on Church doctrine, be able to publicly dialogue with bishops, and play a role in decision making processes. He has also gone so far as to say that he doesn’t believe there’s “a compelling theological reason why the pope can’t name a woman cardinal.” He has aligned himself with Hofstra University professor Phyllis Zagano, a well-known advocate for women’s ordination to the diaconate. Tobin has been a firm opponent of capital punishment and in 2020 joined others in appealing to President Trump to commute a death sentence. He strongly opposes abortion and welcomed the overturning of Roe v Wade. He stated that “abortion represents a failure to recognize the sanctity of human life and promotes a culture in which human life in its most vulnerable moment is perceived as disposable.” He argues that abortion is not healthcare, results in “inhuman and lethal consequences,” and believes that if life is not protected, “no other rights matter.” While acknowledging the grief caused to some Catholics following restrictions on the traditional Roman Rite, Cardinal Tobin has said he does not believe they have been “banished” from the Church. He noted there are still opportunities for it under current Vatican guidelines, though perhaps not to the extent some were accustomed to previously. On sexual abuse, while Tobin has promised to be more open generally and about sex abuse cases in particular, there have been criticisms that he has not fully lived up to this promise regarding the results of some sex abuse cases. He was also criticized for lack of transparency in the wake of the McCarrick scandal and for not being as forthcoming or proactive in addressing the McCarrick scandal as some observers expected or demanded. Cardinal Tobin has steadily grown in prominence during Pope Francis’ pontificate and is a member of several influential Vatican dicasteries. He is viewed by some American Catholics as part of a triad of progressive cardinals closely allied to Pope Francis, the other two being Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago and Cardinal Robert McElroy of San Diego. Tobin is considered the more conciliatory of the three, keen to build bridges with conservatives and moderates. In 2018, Tobin became embroiled in a social media controversy when he accidentally posted a tweet which he said later was intended for one of his sisters. Cardinal Tobin is fluent in English, Spanish, Italian, French, and Portuguese, and can read several other languages.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Tobin is a progressive thinker whose views align closely with those of Pope Francis, advocating for social justice, immigration reform, and LGBTQ rights within the Church.

229,José Tolentino de Mendonça,"Cardinal José Tolentino Calaça de Mendonça is a poet, biblical scholar and educator in his native Portugal, and a prelate very much on the “progressive” wing of the Church with a close affinity to Pope Francis. Born in Funchal, Madeira, in 1965, he is one of the youngest members of the College of Cardinals. He spent his early years in Angola, where his father worked as a fisherman. Those years were marked by fond memories but also the traumatic experience of witnessing the murder of a man, an event that deeply influenced him, and that he later wrote about in his poetry. Angola was a Portuguese colony at the time, though the war for independence was already underway. Following the 25 April revolution in Portugal, the colonies were promised independence, which led to the white population fleeing en masse. The Mendonça family returned to Madeira when he was ten years old, but the cardinal’s African experience left a mark on him.1  After returning to Madeira in 1975, Tolentino entered the minor seminary and earned a degree in theology from the Catholic University of Portugal in Lisbon in 1989. He was ordained the following year for the Diocese of Funchal, but he only served as a parish priest in Madeira for three years, before his academic pursuits led him back to the Patriarchate of Lisbon. Tolentino’s academic and pastoral career includes roles such as seminary professor, parish priest, and rector of the Pontifical Portuguese College in Rome. He earned a master’s degree in biblical sciences from the Pontifical Biblical Institute in Rome in 1992. Cardinal Tolentino had a prolific career at the Portuguese Catholic University (UCP): After earning his bachelor’s degree in theology in 1989 and his doctorate in biblical theology in 2004 from UCP, he served as assistant professor from 1996 to 1999 and later as full professor. His dedication to academia culminated in his appointment as Vice-Rector in 2012 and Dean of the Faculty of Theology in 2018. He also held several academic roles at an international level, including visiting professorships at the Catholic University of Pernambuco, the Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro, and the Jesuit School of Philosophy and Theology of Belo Horizonte, all in Brazil. Additionally, he was a Straus Fellow at New York University during the academic year 2011-2012, contributing to a research team focused on “Religion and Public Reason.” Throughout his career, Cardinal Tolentino de Mendonça has also served in significant ecclesiastical roles. He was the first director of the Portuguese Bishops Conference’s National Secretariat for Culture from 2004 to 2014, fostering dialogue between the Church and the broader cultural milieu in Portugal. Though the secretariat was nominally under the tutelage of a bishop, then Father Tolentino was clearly running the show and the bishops were happy to let him do so. In 2018 Pope Francis chose Tolentino to preach the spiritual exercises for the Roman Curia in Ariccia, and, four months later, he appointed him as archivist and librarian of the Holy Roman Church, elevating him at the same time to archbishop. In 2019, he was made a cardinal and appointed to several Vatican dicasteries. Naturally, this meant he had to leave Lisbon and move to Rome. In September 2022, Francis then appointed  Cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça prefect of the Dicastery for Culture and Education. Tolentino has attracted considerable controversy during his priestly life, namely for sympathizing with heterodox and tolerant approaches to homosexuality (although never publicly speaking against Church teaching on this area) and allying himself with a radical feminist Benedictine sister who promotes abortion, women’s ordination, same-sex “marriage,” and the adoption of children by same-sex couples.  He views such acts as part of an effort of engaging the Church with modern culture. He speaks fluent Portuguese and Italian, and reasonable English, besides the classical languages of ancient Hebrew and Greek, essential to his scholarly work. He is a passionate and prolific reader and lover of literature; his poetry is highly regarded by specialists, but notably more in the secular sphere than religious. Some of his poems refer to religious themes, but his work cannot be pegged as being religious, covering a wide variety of human experiences.2 To mark the 70th anniversary of the death of the controversial Jesuit Father Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, Tolentino penned a preface to a new biography of the late paleontologist whose works have been censured by the Vatican since 1962 — a censure that has never been lifted. The cardinal praised Teilhard’s writings and his biographer. His role in the Dicastery for Culture and Education and his connection with influential groups like the Community of Sant’Egidio, the United Nations, and allies in the Roman Curia, bolster his profile as a significant modernist figure within the contemporary Catholic Church. In terms of governance, he has shown himself to be capable, holding numerous positions of authority, but Tolentino’s administrative skills have been questioned. He is also not known to be a team player and can be difficult to work with. Among progressives, Tolentino is seen as a potential compromise candidate in the next conclave, especially if other such figures as Cardinal Matteo Zuppi do not succeed. Veteran vaticanist Sandro Magister reported in March 2025 that the Sant’Egidio community was supporting him as a papal candidate. A Tolentino de Mendonça papacy would be a return to a European Pope, but one who hails from the peripheries of Europe, having been raised in Angola and the Island of Madeira. Indeed, despite his relative youth, his papabile status within the College of Cardinals should not be underestimated. He is close to Pope Francis on most issues and greatly esteems the Argentinian pontiff. For those cardinal-electors wanting a continuity candidate, someone certainly heterodox and modernist with perhaps an even greater revolutionary impulse than Francis, the Portuguese cardinal from Madeira could be their ideal candidate.3","• Theology/Ideology: Tolentino de Mendonça embodies a progressive theology, promoting engagement between the Church and modern culture while maintaining a nuanced stance on contentious issues such as homosexuality.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for being intellectually formidable and passionate, yet his administrative skills and team collaboration have been questioned, making him a complex negotiator.  
• Power Base: His connections with influential groups like the Community of Sant’Egidio and allies in the Roman Curia enhance his profile as a significant modernist figure within the Church.  
• Core Motivation: Cardinal Tolentino is driven by a desire to foster dialogue between faith and contemporary societal issues, seeking to bridge the gap between traditional Church teachings and modern cultural realities.","Cardinal José Tolentino de Mendonça is recognized for his progressive theological approach, advocating for meaningful engagement between the Church and contemporary culture while navigating complex issues with sensitivity.

230,Silvano Tomasi,"Cardinal Silvano Maria Tomasi is a migrant specialist and former Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations in Geneva who was brought out of retirement to steer important and ultimately successful reform of the Order of Malta. Born on October 12, 1940, in Casoni di Mussolente, Italy, Tomasi was ordained as a priest of the Congregation of the Missionaries of St. Charles (Scalabrinians) on May 31, 1965. He pursued higher education in the United States, earning a doctorate in sociology from Fordham University in New York. Early in his career, Tomasi served as an assistant professor of sociology at the City University of New York and the New School for Social Research from 1970 to 1974. He co-founded the Center for Migration Studies in New York and established the International Migration Review, showcasing his commitment to migration issues. From 1983 to 1987, he directed the Office for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Refugees at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. Tomasi’s diplomatic career began on June 27, 1989, when Pope John Paul II appointed him Secretary of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant Peoples. He was consecrated bishop on August 17, 1996, and served as Apostolic Nuncio to Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Djibouti. In 2003, he was appointed Permanent Observer of the Holy See to the United Nations in Geneva, a position he held until 2016. Throughout his tenure, Tomasi addressed various global issues, including child protection, labor rights, and autonomous weapons systems. In comments made in 2009, Tomasi noted that eighty to ninety percent of abuse by priests is committed by a homosexual minority who are “sexually engaged with adolescent boys between the ages of eleven and seventeen.” He also remarked that as the Catholic Church has been “busy cleaning its own house, it would be good if other institutions and authorities, where the major part of abuses are reported, could do the same and inform the media about it.” In 2015, he spoke out against jihadist violence, describing it as “genocide.” Pope Francis elevated Tomasi to the rank of cardinal on November 28, 2020, assigning him the title of Cardinal-Deacon of San Nicola in Carcere. On November 1, 2020, Francis appointed him Special Delegate to the Sovereign Military Order of Malta. During his tenure, he oversaw the reform process of the Order’s constitutional charter and code while maintaining its sovereign status. He was involved in proposing changes to create a more united and fraternal Order after conflict and tensions had emerged in recent years. Tomasi was central to all discussions regarding the Order’s reform, balancing its Catholic identity with its unique sovereign status in international law and its global diplomatic and humanitarian work. The cardinal suffers from early stages of Parkinson’s disease.

231,Désiré Tsarahazana,"Cardinal Désiré Tsarahazana, the Archbishop of Toamasina, Madagascar, is a staunch defender of marriage and the family who has dedicated his priestly life to helping the poor in one of the world’s poorest countries. Born on June 13, 1954, in Amboangibe, a region in northeastern Madagascar known for producing eighty percent of the world’s vanilla, Tsarahazana studied at minor seminary from 1970 to 1976 and then continued his studies at Antsiranana ou Diego-Suarez until 1978. He studied for the priesthood from 1979 to 1982, and took further studies in philosophy and theology from 1983 to 1986, including at the Catholic University of Lyon in France. He was ordained priest on September 28, 1986, at the age of 32. Tsarahazana’s leadership qualities and dedication to his faith led to his appointment as Bishop of Fenoarivo Atsinanana, Madagascar, on February 18, 2001, at the age of 46. This position allowed him to serve the local community and gain valuable experience in Church administration. On November 24, 2008, at the age of 54, Tsarahazana was appointed Bishop of Toamasina, Madagascar, one of the country’s major cities. In 2010, the see of Toamasina was elevated, and Tsarahazana became its first archbishop. During his tenure as archbishop, the numbers of priests and religious have roughly doubled, although numbers remain relatively low and he has appealed for missionaries. “There has been a growth in the number of seminarians, but with the extreme poverty we face here, we have to constantly ask ourselves if it is a matter of true vocations or if it is more a matter of looking for material security,” he said in 2018. From 2006 to 2012, Tsarahazana was vice president of the Madagascan bishops’ conference. He was elected president in 2012 and after re-elections, he remains in the post. The cardinal took part in the 2018 Vatican Synod on Youth. That same year, Pope Francis appointed him cardinal in recognition of his contributions to the Church and his dedication to serving the poor in Madagascar. Throughout his career, Cardinal Tsarahazana has been known for his quiet but impactful work in improving the lives of the country’s poor. His efforts have focused on addressing the needs of the underprivileged in his community, aligning with the Church’s mission of social justice and compassion, and Francis’ emphasis on assisting the poor. He has reportedly been a driving force in addressing the needs of the underprivileged in Madagascar, which is one of the world’s poorest countries. More than 90 percent of its population lives below the two-dollar-a-day poverty line. The cardinal has been instrumental in efforts to improve education in Madagascar, as well as healthcare access and living conditions. Cardinal Tsarahazana is known for his willingness to travel long distances, even walking up to ten miles or more, to reach remote villages and connect with people in rural areas. He has also partnered with Catholic Relief Services on projects aimed at improving living conditions, but takes a holistic approach that also includes providing spiritual support and advocacy for the poor. He has also criticized corruption in Madagascar. “Ours is a country of great contrasts. We have many resources, but the country is deteriorating,” he has said. “There is a deterioration that is mostly linked to corruption.” The Madagascan cardinal strongly defends family values and Catholic teaching on marriage in his country. He emphasizes that in Malagasy culture, marriage is deeply rooted in the procreation of children and the continuation of family lines and cites a Malagasy proverb — “We get married to have children” — to illustrate this point. The cardinal views this connection between marriage and procreation as a core aspect of Malagasy identity that is not easily influenced by modern ideologies seeking to redefine family structures. In 2018, he emphasized the need for deeper faith among Christians, saying: “If we were truly Christians, we would not be where we are. How deep is our faith in reality? Numbers are a good thing, but not the most important.” He has expressed concern about the rise of radical Islam and the increase in mosques in his country.

232,Emil Paul Tscherrig,"Cardinal Emil Paul Tscherrig is a veteran Swiss Vatican diplomat who has had a positive and close relationship with Pope Francis and shares the Pope’s vision for the Church, especially regarding reform and synodality. Born on February 3, 1947, in Unterems, Switzerland, he was the eldest of eight children in a mountain farmer family. Tscherrig was ordained a priest on April 11, 1974, for the Diocese of Sion. He then studied and obtained a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Gregorian University before entering the diplomatic service of the Holy See in 1978. Throughout his career, Tscherrig has held numerous diplomatic positions. He began working in the Secretariat of State, assisting in preparations for Pope John Paul II’s international trips. In 1992 the Pope conferred to him the titular of Honorary Prelate of His Holiness. He then went on to serve as secretary in apostolic nunciatures to Uganda, South Korea, Mongolia and Bangladesh. His first major appointment came on May 4, 1996, when Pope John Paul II named him titular archbishop of Voli and Apostolic Nuncio to Burundi. His episcopal consecration was presided over by Cardinal Secretary of State Angelo Sodano on June 27 of the same year. This marked the beginning of a series of diplomatic assignments that would span several continents. Tscherrig served as apostolic nuncio to various countries in the Caribbean and Antilles region, South Korea, Mongolia, and the Nordic countries. In 2008 Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as nuncio to the Nordic countries (Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway), with an office in Stockholm. In January 2012, he was appointed apostolic nuncio to Argentina where he came to know its then archbishop, Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio. In 2017, Pope Francis appointed him apostolic nuncio to Italy and San Marino, making him the first non-Italian to hold the position and breaking the long-standing “Italian exception” in Vatican diplomacy.1 On September 30, 2023, Pope Francis elevated Tscherrig to the rank of cardinal. Cardinal Tscherrig has expressed hope for Church reform through synodality, stating: “I hope that the synodal process will successfully bring the necessary changes in the Church.” He has also said “a lot of work still needs to be done so that, in addition to the priests, the laity are also more involved in church affairs.” He has expressed concern about divisions within the Church, stating, “The lack of unity is a wound that the Church suffers, a very painful one.” During the 2014 Synod on the Family, Tscherrig supported a more flexible pastoral approach to people in “irregular situations,” emphasizing meeting people where they are and leading them closer to holiness. This indicates that he supports the teaching in Amoris Laetitia that seemed to allow people who are divorced and civilly remarried to receive Holy Communion in some cases. It is not clear what languages Tscherrig speaks apart from Swiss German, but given his diplomatic work it can be inferred he speaks English, Spanish and Italian.","• Theology/Ideology: Tscherrig advocates for Church reform and synodality, emphasizing the need for greater laity involvement in church affairs.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his diplomatic skills and ability to foster positive relationships, particularly with Pope Francis and various global leaders.  
• Power Base: Tscherrig's extensive diplomatic experience and close ties with Pope Francis position him as a significant figure in the Vatican's reform agenda.  
• Core Motivation: His primary motivation lies in healing divisions within the Church and promoting a more inclusive and flexible pastoral approach.","Cardinal Emil Paul Tscherrig is a prominent advocate for Church reform and synodality, emphasizing the importance of increased lay participation in ecclesiastical matters.

233,Peter Kodwo Appia Turkson,"Cardinal Peter Turkson has indicated that he is well acquainted with the need for “coexisting” with people from diverse backgrounds, as he was born into a family of ten children of a Catholic father and a mother who was a convert from a Methodist sect. He also had a Muslim paternal uncle. At the age of fourteen, he entered a minor seminary in Ghana. He continued in a regional seminary from 1969 to 1971. From 1971 to 1974, he studied at a seminary run by Franciscans in New York State, before being ordained in Ghana in 1975. After a brief stint teaching in a minor seminary, he was sent to Rome, where, after four years, he earned a license at the Pontifical Biblical Institute (Biblicum) in 1980. For the next six years, he taught in a seminary while also assisting in a parish. In 1987, Turkson’s bishop sent him back to Rome, this time to earn a doctorate. However, John Paul II asked Turkson to become a bishop in 1992, and the doctorate was never completed. In 1993, Turkson was consecrated a bishop and took up his role as archbishop of Cape Coast, Ghana. Having been elected president of the Ghana Bishops’ Conference, Turkson served in that position from 1997 to 2005. During this period, in 2003, John Paul II created Turkson a cardinal-priest at the relatively young age of fifty-five. From 2006 to 2010, he served as the chairman of the Ghanaian National Peace Council (NPC), established with the help of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In that capacity, he helped the country peacefully elect a president in 2008, despite countrywide tensions. He sees Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador as a model. A year later, in 2009, in view of Turkson’s background in social justice and affiliations with the UN, Benedict XVI appointed him president of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace. Pope Francis confirmed him in that position in 2013. In 2017, Turkson became the prefect of the new “super dicastery” for Promoting Integral Human Development, the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace having been juridically dissolved. In 2020, Pope Francis appointed Turkson coordinator of a five-group Vatican task force to respond to the socioeconomic fallout from the coronavirus. In April 2022, at the end of his five year term, Turkson handed in his resignation as prefect of the dicastery which Pope Francis accepted and appointed him chancellor of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and the Pontifical Academy of Social Sciences. The change followed an inspection of the dicastery led by Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago that led to personnel changes and a reorganization of the dicastery. A fully modern cardinal who for many years has been the darling of Western liberals wanting to see a malleable African pope, Cardinal Peter Turkson appreciates the influence of the Second Vatican Council in the Church and the world at large. He came to the Vatican with some surprise and trepidation but soon embraced the role and ended up overseeing one of the first major curial reforms under Pope Francis: the merger of his pontifical council with two others into a “super dicastery” headed by him. With pastoral and curial experience under his belt, Turkson has committed himself to addressing some of the most prominent issues of the day, including human rights, ecology, and corruption. Given his curial role, he has focused almost exclusively on socioeconomic issues and sees no excessive emphasis on the temporal at the expense of the spiritual. As a bishop, he was especially active in Ghana and the African continent, while his work as a cardinal has established a global platform for his apostolic activity. Ready to engage with non-Catholics, Turkson has generally not shied away from affirming the Church’s traditional positions on the priesthood, marriage between a man and a woman, and homosexuality — although his views on the latter significantly loosened during Francis’ pontificate. While condemning abortion and euthanasia, he is permissive regarding the use of contraceptives in certain circumstances. And despite his close interaction with United Nations officials and affiliations over the years, he has generally steered clear of publicly warning against “reproductive health” policies — that is, abortion and contraception, which the UN fiercely promotes. Given that some of his family is Muslim, he denounces Islamophobia while not turning a blind eye to the dangers that Islam poses to human freedom in Africa as well as in the West, especially to migrants. Turkson’s enthusiastic support for Pope Francis’ Encyclical Laudato Si’ and ecological conservation is contextualized by his recognition that “human ecology,” especially the protection of human life, takes precedence. This concern has been extensively taken up in his new role as chancellor of the pontifical academies. Cardinal Turkson has also been actively involved in the World Economic Forum (WEF) meetings in Davos, representing the Vatican’s interests and perspectives on global economic issues. His participation has focused on promoting a vision of economic development that aligns with the principles of social justice and the common good. He has also controversially been criticized for involving the Vatican with the Council for Inclusive Capitalism which has come under fire from the political left and the right. A cardinal with significant pastoral and international experience whose approach resonates with the political left, globalists and the environmentally conscious on the world stage, Cardinal Turkson would doubtless continue the trajectory begun by Pope Francis while representing a continent where the Faith is growing the fastest.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Turkson emphasizes the importance of human rights, ecology, and social justice within a framework that respects traditional Catholic teachings.  
• Personality/Negotiation: Known for his ability to engage with diverse groups, Turkson effectively navigates complex issues while maintaining a commitment to dialogue and coexistence.  
• Power Base: His extensive experience in both pastoral roles and curial leadership, alongside his global connections, positions him as a prominent figure within the Church and beyond.  
• Core Motivation: Turkson is driven by a desire to address pressing contemporary issues while promoting the Church's mission of social justice and integral human development.","Cardinal Peter Kodwo Appia Turkson is a distinguished leader within the Church, recognized for his commitment to human rights, ecology, and social justice, all while upholding traditional Catholic teachings.

234,Agostino Vallini,"Cardinal Agostino Vallini is retired Italian prelate and accomplished canon lawyer who served as vicar general of Rome and held numerous leadership positions at the Vatican, including prefect of the Apostolic Signatura. Born on April 17, 1940, in Poli, Diocese of Tivoli, Italy[, Vallini was ordained priest on July 19, 1964, for the Archdiocese of Naples. After completing his studies in Rome, where he obtained a doctorate in utroque iure (both civil and canon law), Vallini began teaching canon law in Naples. In 1971, he was called back to Rome to lecture on ecclesiastical public law at the Pontifical Lateran University. He dedicated himself to this work while continuing part-time teaching and parish duties in Naples. In 1978, Vallini was appointed rector of the major seminary in Naples. His episcopal career began on March 23, 1989, when he was appointed Auxiliary Bishop of Naples and Titular Bishop of Tortibulum. He received episcopal ordination on May 13, 1989. On November 13, 1999, he was appointed Bishop of Albano, Italy.

On November 4, 2017, he was nominated Pontifical Legate for the Basilicas of St. Francis and Santa Maria degli Angeli in Assisi. Cardinal Vallini’s career has been characterized by his dedication to canon law, education, and his service in key leadership positions. He once spoke out against the distribution of condoms in Rome schools, viewing it as trivializing sexuality and education. He also emphasized the importance of teaching young people to value their bodies and sexuality as gifts from God. Cardinal Vallini continues to serve the Church in various capacities, drawing on his extensive experience in canon law and ecclesiastical administration.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Vallini holds a traditional view on sexuality and education, emphasizing the sanctity of the human body and the importance of canon law.

235,Antonio Maria Veglìo,"Cardinal Antonio Maria Vegliò is a retired Holy See diplomat and a veteran Roman Curia official who served in a number of high ranking Vatican positions under three popes. Born on February 3, 1938, in Macerata Feltria, Italy, Vegliò was ordained priest for the diocese of Pesaro in 1962 and later attended the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy, where he studied diplomacy. His diplomatic career began in 1985 when he was appointed Titular Archbishop of Eclano and Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. He then served as Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to several African countries, including Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Cape Verde, and Mali, from 1989 to 1997. His diplomatic service continued with appointments as Apostolic Nuncio to Lebanon and Kuwait from 1997 to 1999. In 2001, Vegliò transitioned to a role within the Roman Curia, becoming Secretary of the Vatican Congregation for the Oriental Churches. His responsibilities further expanded in 2009 when Pope Benedict XVI appointed him President of the Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerants. Vegliò’s service to the Church was recognized on February 18, 2012, when Pope Benedict XVI elevated him to the rank of Cardinal-Deacon of San Cesareo in Palatio. He participated in the 2013 papal conclave that elected Pope Francis. On June 1, 2013, Pope Francis appointed Cardinal Vegliò to the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State.

236,Fernando Vérgez Alzaga,"Cardinal Fernando Vérgez Álzaga, a senior Vatican official whose uninterrupted curial service dates back to the early 1970s, is a Legionary of Christ who very late in life and thanks to Pope Francis’ guardianship rapidly rose through the ranks to become head of Vatican City State and a cardinal. Born on March 1, 1945 in Salamanca (Spain), little is known about his personal life until December 1965, when he made his vows of perpetual profession in the Congregation of the Legionaries of Christ (LC). He was then ordained a priest in November 1969 in Rome by Cardinal Ildebrando Antoniutti, in the Roman Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe and St. Philip. Vérgez then entered the Pontifical Gregorian University to study Philosophy and Theology, obtaining a license in both disciplines according to the various biographies that are known of the Spanish prelate, but none of them reports the date on which he would have reached the academic degree. Even though he did not come from a wealthy family, his personal acquaintance with the later-disgraced founder of the Legionaries, Father Maciel Marcial, allowed him to come to Rome to study and pursue an anomalous “career” as a non-community religious. He was close to Argentine Cardinal (now Blessed) Edoardo Francisco Pironio (following Pironio’s death, he shared living quarters with Monsignor Brian Farrell, L.C. in an apartment in the Holy Office). In 1972 he began working at the Holy See, where he has remained, holding various positions up until the present day. From then on, his entire priestly life took place within the Vatican Walls, in the Roman Curia, rather than in the Legionaries of Christ. He has worked under five pontiffs: St. Paul VI, Blessed John Paul I, St. John Paul II, Benedict XVI and Francis. His first assignment was the Sacred Congregation for Institutes of Religious Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, where in December 1975 he met Cardinal Pironio who was appointed prefect of the Congregation that year. Vérgez became his personal secretary. In 1984 Pironio was transferred to the Pontifical Council for the Laity and appointed president of the dicastery by Pope John Paul II. Pironio and Vérgez worked closely for twenty-three years until Cardinal Pironio’s death on February 5, 1998. A striking fact shows the spiritual affinity and friendship that united the two: when he was appointed for the first time to an episcopal office —- as auxiliary bishop of La Plata (Buenos Aires, Argentina) — by Paul VI in 1964, Pironio chose as the motto of his coat of arms the Pauline phrase of Col 1:27: “Christus in vobis, spes gloriae” [Christ among you, the hope of glory]. When he was first appointed bishop in 2013, Fernando Vérgez chose the same motto for his episcopal coat of arms. During that time, through frequent trips to Buenos Aires and thanks to Pironio and Cardinal Antonio Quarracino, Vérgez became well acquainted with Jorge Mario Bergoglio. A shy man little accustomed to theology, Vérgez prefers the office to homilies and, despite not having great computer knowledge but partly thanks to his superiors in the Legion, in 2004 then-Father Vérgez was appointed head of the Internet Department of the Holy See. In 2008, thanks to his friendship with Archbishop Renato Boccardo, then-secretary general of the Governorate (government of Vatican City State), he was appointed director of the Directorate of Telecommunications of the Governorate. On August 30, 2013, Pope Francis appointed him secretary general of the Government of Vatican City State, at the same time announced he was making him a bishop, assigning him the title of Villamagna in Proconsulari (an ancient diocese of Tunisia currently non-existent, located 50 km from the ancient city of Carthage). On November 15 of that year he was consecrated bishop by Pope Francis in St. Peter’s Basilica, accompanied by Cardinal Giuseppe Bertello and Bishop Brian Farrell L.C. as co-consecrators. Cardinal Vérgez is friends with Bertello, Farrell and his brother, Cardinal Kevin Farrell, an ex-Legionary of Christ. On August 30, 2018, Vérgez was confirmed secretary general of the Governorate of Vatican City State, and on September 29, 2020, he was appointed a member of the Commission on Reserved Matters, created by Pope Francis to oversee the confidentiality of the Holy See’s economic affairs. On September 8, 2021, Francis appointed him president of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State and president of the Governorate of Vatican City State, elevating his episcopal dignity to archbishop. The president of the Pontifical Commission and Governorate serves as the head of government of Vatican City. In August the following year, Pope Francis elevated him to the College of Cardinals, making him cardinal deacon of Santa Maria delle Mercedes and San Adriano in Villa Albani. Vérgez Álzaga is a member of the Dicastery for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life (since September 2022) and a member of the Council of Cardinals (since March 2023). From the time he began his priestly work in the Roman Curia in 1972 until his promotion to the forefront of the Vatican hierarchy in 2013, there are practically no known public statements, writings or homilies from Cardinal Vérgez. This is surprising and it is practically impossible to extract phrases, concepts or teachings that would allow us to know his thoughts on Catholic Revelation and the Catholic Faith. He is recorded as having graduated in philosophy and theology, but without the year of graduation being reported. It is also very striking that, despite his alleged “humanistic” formation, his work assignments have been more technical than pastoral, including him being appointed head of Vatican City State and a member of Pope Francis’ Council of Cardinals that advise Francis on Church governance and reform. Except for his adherence to the concepts of the Church as “missionary” and “synodal,” there is no trace in his statements that allows us to glimpse, intuit or know his philosophical and theological thought. Little, in fact, is known about the priestly life and work of Cardinal Fernando Vérgez Álzaga. His ecclesiastical life has been developed almost entirely in the Roman Curia, under the pontificates of five Popes and in particular accompanying the Blessed Argentine Cardinal Eduardo Francisco Pironio for 25 years as his personal secretary. But all this has happened without any known preaching or public pronouncements except in recent years, when he was promoted in the Holy See to assume positions of institutional responsibility. What is known about the cardinal is that he is an obedient servant of popes, always willing and able to implement whatever measures they wish to propose. Those who have worked with him say he is a shy man who demands a lot from himself and from his subordinates but, like many in the Legion, is absolutely subservient to his superiors whom he never contradicts. His rapid rise through the ecclesiastical hierarchy has been a surprise to his friends and those who have worked with him.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Vérgez aligns with the missionary and synodal concepts of the Church, reflecting a commitment to the current papal vision under Pope Francis.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is characterized as a shy and obedient servant, known for demanding high standards from himself and his colleagues without contradicting his superiors.  
• Power Base: His power is derived from his extensive curial experience and close relationships with influential figures in the Vatican, particularly Pope Francis and other senior cardinals.  
• Core Motivation: Vérgez is motivated by a deep sense of duty to the papacy, consistently demonstrating loyalty and a willingness to execute the wishes of his superiors.","Cardinal Fernando Vérgez Alzaga exemplifies a steadfast commitment to the missionary and synodal principles of the Church, aligning closely with the vision set forth by Pope Francis.

237,Giuseppe Versaldi,"Cardinal Giuseppe Versaldi is a retired progressive-leaning senior Vatican official who led the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See and the Congregation for Catholic Education. Born on July 30, 1943, in Villarboit, Vercelli, Italy, Versaldi was ordained priest on June 29, 1967, for the Diocese of Vercelli. His academic pursuits led him to Rome in 1972, where he earned a degree in psychology and a doctorate in canon law from the Pontifical Gregorian University. Upon returning to Vercelli in 1976, Versaldi established the diocesan Family Counseling centre and became its director. He also served as the president of the Piedmontese Federation of Christian Counsellors. In 1977, he was appointed pastor of the Parish of Larizza. Versaldi’s expertise in canon law and psychology led to his appointment as a professor at the Pontifical Gregorian University in 1980. His judicial career in the Church began in 1985 when he was appointed as a tribunal clerk of the Supreme Tribunal of the Apostolic Signatura, eventually becoming a voting member in 1990 and a member of the Supreme Council in 2007. On April 4, 2007, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Versaldi as Bishop of Alessandria. He was consecrated on May 26, 2007, and installed on June 10 of the same year[1]. His leadership abilities were further recognized when he was named President of the Prefecture for the Economic Affairs of the Holy See on September 21, 2011, with the rank of archbishop. In February 2012 Pope Benedict XVI elevated Versaldi to the cardinalate. He participated in the 2013 conclave that elected Pope Francis. On March 31, 2015, Pope Francis appointed Versaldi as Prefect of the Congregation for Catholic Education, a position he held until 2022 when the congregation was merged into the new Dicastery for Culture and Education. In this role, he oversaw Catholic schools and academic institutions worldwide, establishing guidelines and assisting diocesan bishops in supervising schools, training educators, and caring for students.

238,Jean-Paul Vesco,"Cardinal Jean-Paul Vesco, the Archbishop of Algiers, is a French-born Dominican prelate known for his progressive views that include advocating a re-evaluation of the Church’s treatment of civilly remarried divorcees, calling for a women’s diaconate, and normalizing homosexual relationships in the Church. Born on March 10, 1962, in Lyon, France, Vesco earned law and business administration degrees and went on to practice business law in Lyon and Paris for seven years before experiencing a significant change in his life path. In 1995, he joined the Dominican Order, taking his vows on September 14, 1996. He was ordained priest on June 24, 2001. Vesco’s connection with Algeria began in 2002 when he moved to Tlemcen, reestablishing the Dominican presence in the Diocese of Oran six years after the assassination of Bishop Pierre Claverie.1 His dedication to the region led to several important roles, including serving as vicar general of the diocese from 2005 to 2010 and as diocesan treasurer from 2007 to 2010. In December 2012, Pope Benedict XVI appointed Vesco as the Bishop of Oran, a position he held until 2021. During his tenure, in 2018, he organized the beatification of 19 Algerian martyrs who included Bishop Claverie and the Trappist monks of Tibhirine. In December, 2021, Pope Francis appointed Vesco as the Archbishop of Algiers, further cementing his importance in the region. In a remarkable development, on February 27, 2023, Algerian President Abdelmadjid Tebboune granted Vesco Algerian citizenship by presidential decree, a rare honor for a foreigner. Pope Francis elevated him to the College of Cardinals on December 7, 2024. A jogging fanatic, Vesco is well known for his progressive views within the Church. In 2015, he called for a re-evaluation of the Church’s treatment of divorced Catholics who remarry, stating that the current discipline “troubled” and even “revolted” him due to what he saw as unnecessary suffering that it inflicts on individuals without considering their unique situations. Regarding his pastoral approach to “LGBTQ” individuals and same-sex couples, Vesco endorsed the Vatican document Fiducia Supplicans. As part of the Regional Episcopal Conference of North Africa (CERNA), he supported a statement affirming that couples in “irregular situations” would be given blessings per the declaration. The statement emphasized that everyone deserves unconditional respect under the Gospel, and the Church should focus on welcoming, listening, praying with, and accompanying people on a path of growth and conversion. Notably, Vesco stressed that CERNA’s statement was issued because they did not subscribe to an earlier one put out by the Symposium of Episcopal Conferences of Africa and Madagascar (SECAM). That statement, issued on behalf of all Africa’s bishops, effectively rejected Fiducia Supplicans. Vesco said CERNA’s statement was prompted because SECAM’s letter “is not what we intended to convey to our dioceses.” Vesco has expressed support for synodality in that he wishes to see increased sharing of responsibility and accountability in Church governance. He believes that responsibility in the Church increases as it is shared, and that the Church suffers from a deficit of accountability. He advocates for thinking of the Church more as a community of brothers and sisters, emphasizing fraternity over power struggles. While not explicitly addressing women’s ordination, Vesco has expressed strong support for expanding women’s roles in the Church. He supports the idea of a female diaconate and wishes to see it implemented. He also advocates allowing women and trained lay people to comment on the Word of God during Sunday celebrations. Vesco believes the Church needs to think about women’s roles not just in terms of complementarity but also in terms of otherness, reflecting societal changes in how tasks and responsibilities are shared. As Archbishop of Algiers in a predominantly Muslim country, Vesco has been a strong proponent of interfaith dialogue and fostering fraternity between different religious communities. He has expressed his intention to remain in Algeria for the rest of his life, viewing his role as a bridge between cultures and faiths. However, Vesco has taken a strong line against Israel, calling Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s actions “genocidal” and saying that while Hamas’ actions were “inexcusable,” they were “not without cause.” Netanyahu and his allies “did not want peace, they did not want a two-state solution, and we are effectively in a logic of annihilation,” he said in December 2024. “This policy is genocidal, which means that there is no way out except after absolutely destroying a people as such. Our position as the Episcopal Conference is to say that war does not bring peace. War will crush, but it will not bring peace.”  He has also praised the 2019 Document on Human Fraternity, saying it is “not just another document on interreligious dialogue, but is the gesture made by two people, two religious leaders, two men who do not try to convince each other.”  “The Pope and the Grand Imam are two men who appreciate each other’s faith,” he said. “And this had never existed to such a degree. When I saw these two men look at each other and smile, I saw two brothers. I perceived the friendship between them. When I had an audience with Pope Francis, I told him that this was the thing that had struck me most about his pontificate, because it is connected to our experience in Algeria.” In December 2024, Cardinal Jean-Paul Vesco spent his second evening as a cardinal sharing a meal with the poor in Rome. Together with other volunteers, he distributed a dinner and small gifts to the homeless just outside St. Peter’s colonnade.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Vesco advocates for progressive reforms within the Church, including the normalization of LGBTQ relationships and the re-evaluation of the treatment of divorced Catholics.

242,Friedrich Wetter,"Cardinal Friedrich Wetter is a retired Archbishop of Munich and Freising and former professor of dogmatic theology whose ecclesiastical career spans over half a century of service. Born on February 20, 1928, in Landau, Germany, Wetter began his academic journey studying philosophy at St. George in Frankfurt before moving to Rome to study theology at the Pontifical Gregorian University. Wetter was ordained priest on October 10, 1953, and subsequently completed his doctorate in theology, focusing on the problem of life after death.

After serving for fourteen years, he was appointed Archbishop of Munich and Freising on October 28, 1982. Wetter’s influence in the Church continued to grow, and on May 25, 1985, he was created and proclaimed Cardinal by Pope John Paul II, with the title of S. Stefano al Monte Celio. Throughout his tenure, Cardinal Wetter held several important positions within the Church. He chaired the Freising Bishops Conference and led the faith commission of the German Bishops’ Conference from 1981 to 2008. He also participated in the 2005 papal conclave that elected Pope Benedict XVI. On February 2, 2007, Pope Benedict XVI accepted Wetter’s resignation as Archbishop of Munich and Freising, though he continued to serve as apostolic administrator until the installation of his successor, Reinhard Marx, in 2008. In his later years, Wetter faced controversy regarding the handling of sexual abuse cases during his tenure as archbishop, as highlighted in a January 2022 report.

243,Rainer Maria Woelki,"Cardinal Rainer Maria Woelki is an influential, conservative, pro-life German cardinal who has also staunchly defended migrants, praised moderate Islam, and promoted ecumenism and environmental protection. In recent years he has faced strong criticism over allegations he mishandled abuse cases and investigations — allegations which were largely thrown out but which nevertheless led to calls for his resignation. Woelki was born on August 18, 1956, in the Cologne district of Mulheim, to a family of Germans expelled from Frombork (now located in northern Poland) as a result of World War II. He and his two younger siblings grew up in a housing development that was built on the initiative of a Catholic priest for people in a similarly deprived situation to the Woelki family. Young Rainer’s environment was very devout, and his desire to follow the path of the priesthood was already clear to him as a child. With some delay caused by his hesitation between choosing the life of a family and that of a priest, he took up theological and philosophical studies in Bonn and Freiburg, not far from Cologne. He was ordained a priest in 1985. In 1990, he became secretary to Cardinal Joachim Meisner, archbishop of Cologne. In 2000, he received a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in Rome for his work on the ecclesiology of the parish. In 2003 he became auxiliary bishop of Cologne and was ordained by Cardinal Meisner. His responsibilities in the archdiocese included pastoral care and dealing with doctrinal and ecumenical issues. In 2011, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him archbishop of Berlin, a city populated mostly by non-Catholics, and the following year Benedict XVI created him a cardinal (with the rank of presbyter), which allowed him to participate in the March 2013 conclave. Pope Francis decided to transfer Cardinal Woelki from Berlin to his home city of Cologne; he took possession of the archdiocese in September 2014. In the new archdiocese, he has been involved in, among other things, clarifying past cases of sexual abuse, as well as leading the resistance against the German Synodal Way. Cardinal Woelki aligns with some of the key themes of Pope Francis’ pontificate. He pays a great deal of attention to migration, both in word and deed. In doctrinal matters he shows himself to be conservative in some areas and more liberal in others. For instance, the cardinal welcomed the Pope Francis’ post-synodal apostolic exhortation on the family, Amoris Laetitia. But he has remained more cautious on other issues, such as the blessing same-sex couples as set forth in Fiducia Supplicans, which he accepted in a spirit of obedience but clearly without enthusiasm, having previously clearly spoken out against the practice of such blessings. Rainer Woelki has been a vociferous critic of the German Synodal Way. He has repeatedly warned of the consequences of ill-considered changes in Church teaching and practice. He rejects the ordination of women to sacred orders and the abolition of celibacy and has refused to accept the implementation of elements of gender theory in teaching and pastoral care. The cardinal has been involved in spreading traditional devotions, such as Eucharistic adoration and praying the rosary. He celebrates the new Mass but maintains good relations with the Priestly Fraternity of St Peter, which exclusively offers the vetus ordo. As head of the large and wealthy Cologne archdiocese, he gained a reputation for financial transparency and great determination in handling sex-abuse scandals. He has also shown great resilience in the face of criticism from the liberal media. However, his social communications have, at times, been awkward and poor, provoking significant backlash — though it must be said that the secular German public can be unforgiving and harsh, as Pope Benedict XVI knew well. Cardinal Woelki has also faced severe, and some would argue unjust, criticism from some of his brother bishops including their conference president. Woelki has been focused on ecumenical and interreligious dialogue. In Cologne and Berlin, he engaged in dialogue with Jews, Muslims and Protestants, maintaining friendly relations with all parties. He has praised non-extremist Islam and believes it is compatible with a Judeo-Christian culture. At the same time, he has pointed out serious doctrinal and moral limitations, especially when it has come to proposals and forms of rapprochement with Protestantism formulated in German-speaking countries. One of the most significant problems the cardinal sees in the modern world is the progressive disregard for the dignity of human life. He has described himself as a “radical defender of life” and, unlike most German bishops, has always explicitly opposed abortion and euthanasia. Woelki has drawn inspiration from Pope Francis, Pope Benedict XVI, and Pope John Paul II, with whom he shares a desire to be close to people, a devotion to the Mother of God and a desire to build a culture of life.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Woelki is a conservative theologian who champions pro-life issues while navigating a complex stance on ecumenism and interreligious dialogue.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He demonstrates resilience in the face of criticism and is known for his financial transparency, although his social communications can be awkward and provoke backlash.  
• Power Base: As the archbishop of Cologne, he leads a large and wealthy archdiocese, positioning him as a significant figure within the German Catholic hierarchy.

244,Donald William Wuerl,"Cardinal Donald William Wuerl is a retired Archbishop of Washington D.C. best known for his commitment to education and evangelization, but who was accused of mishandling financial and sexual abuse cases in the twilight of his ecclesiastical career. Born on November 12, 1940, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Donald Wuerl began his journey in the Catholic Church by entering college seminary at the Athenaeum of Ohio in 1958. Wuerl received his B.A. and M.A. in philosophy from the Catholic University of America in 1963 before continuing his studies at the North American College in Rome. Ordained to the priesthood on December 17, 1966, in St. Peter’s Basilica, Wuerl went on to earn a doctorate in theology from the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas in Rome. His early career included serving as an assistant pastor at St. Rosalia Parish in Pittsburgh and as priest-secretary to Bishop John Wright. From 1969 to 1979, Wuerl worked in Vatican City as Wright’s full-time priest-secretary. Wuerl’s episcopal journey began on November 30, 1985, when he was appointed titular Bishop of Rosemarkie and Auxiliary of Seattle. Pope John Paul II ordained him a bishop on January 6, 1986. He then served as Bishop of Pittsburgh from 1988 to 2006 before being appointed Archbishop of Washington in May 2006. Pope Benedict XVI elevated Wuerl to the College of Cardinals on November 20, 2010, creating him Cardinal-Priest of San Pietro in Vincoli. As a cardinal, Wuerl has served on various Vatican congregations and councils, including those for the Doctrine of the Faith and for Bishops. On October 12, 2018, Pope Francis accepted Cardinal Wuerl’s resignation as Archbishop of Washington, which he had initially offered in 2015 upon reaching the age of 75. The end of Wuerl’s ecclesiastical career was not without controversy, especially regarding his handling of sexual abuse allegations. Wuerl became a prominent figure in discussions about clerical sexual abuse, particularly following the release of the Pennsylvania grand jury report in 2018, which criticized his management of abuse cases during his time as Bishop of Pittsburgh. The report implicated him in covering up abuse and described him as having created a “circle of secrecy” around such cases. Cardinal Wuerl was also involved providing misleading information to secure a $25 million grant for the Istituto Dermopatico dell’Immacolata (IDI), a financially troubled hospital in Rome. The inaccuracies led the board of the Papal Foundation to approve the grant under false pretenses. After internal disagreements became public, Wuerl requested that the Vatican cancel the grant and return the funds. Cardinal Wuerl’s involvement in the case of Theodore McCarrick also cast a shadow over his legacy as it was characterized by a pattern of limited disclosure and carefully worded statements, which eroded trust in his leadership. Despite these clouds over his career, Wuerl remains known for his commitment to education and evangelization. He established the Saint John Paul II Seminary in 2011 and launched various initiatives to encourage faith sharing and religious education. Wuerl is also a prolific author, having written numerous articles and more than a dozen books, including best-selling catechisms.","• Theology/Ideology: Wuerl emphasizes education and evangelization within the Catholic Church, advocating for a deepened understanding of faith among the laity.

246,Lazzaro You Heung-sik,"Cardinal Lazarus You Heung-sik, a member of the Focolare Movement, is currently prefect of the Dicastery of the Clergy in Rome, appointed by Pope Francis in 2021 after serving more than fifteen years as a diocesan bishop in South Korea. Born in South Korea in 1951 during the Korean War, Heung-sik’s father disappeared during the conflict and young Lazarus grew up without a father in his life. As a teenager he became the first person in his family to convert to Catholicism and was baptized at the age of sixteen. He was drawn to the faith by ‘pioneers’ of Korean Catholicism, in particular by St. Andrew Kim. He eventually convinced his mother and siblings also to join the Church. “When others see our joy as Christians, they are contaminated,” the cardinal has said. Nuns encouraged him to become a priest and he embarked on a path to ordination at the age of 18, studying at the Catholic University of Korea in Seoul before going to Rome and earning a degree in dogmatic theology at the Pontifical Lateran University. However, he found his time in the seminary disappointing as it did not live up to what he had envisioned. This led to Heung-sik joining the Focolare Movement and spending time in Frascati near Rome. Eventually, in 1979, at the age of 28, he was ordained a priest in the Daejeon diocese. He served in various roles including assistant priest at the diocesan cathedral, director of an education center and of a retreat house. He served as rector of the Daejeon seminary from 1998 to 2003. Pope John Paul II appointed Heung-sik coadjutor bishop of Daejeon on June 24, 2003 and two years later he succeeded Bishop Joseph Kyeong Kap-ryong as diocesan bishop. He was named a member of the Pontifical Council Cor Unum by Pope Benedict XVI on May 29, 2007. Within the Korean Bishops’ Conference You Heung-sik was appointed to lead committees on the martyrs, youth and migration. He also served as head of Caritas Korea from 2004-2008, and in this role made four visits to the North Korean capital Pyongyang. In 2014, then-Bishop Heung-sik invited Pope Francis to visit South Korea for Asian World Youth Day. He met the Pope at the conclusion of the event, and would go on to have several audiences with Francis at the Vatican in the years later. Pope Francis personally invited him to participate in the Vatican Synod on Youth in 2018. On October 14, 2020 he was chosen by his fellow bishops to serve as secretary of the Korean Bishops’ Conference, effectively the third highest position within the conference, after the president and vice-president. In 2021, Pope Francis named him Prefect of the Congregation for Clergy, replacing Cardinal Benjamin Stella, and one year later created him a cardinal at the August 27, 2022 consistory. Heung-sik was subsequently appointed a member of the Dicastery for Bishops; for Evangelization (section for Fundamental Questions regarding Evangelization in the World); for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, for Culture and Education; for Legislative Texts and the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State. He has extensive experience as a seminary rector and diocesan bishop and was entrusted by his fellow Korean bishops with important positions within the bishops’ conference. As a prelate relatively new to the Vatican, Heung-sik has largely avoided becoming caught up in controversies. He has also stayed out of the limelight while emphasizing reform of the seminaries. But as a new East Asian cardinal, Heung-sik is fairly well-placed to be a compromise candidate, and his leanings are not straightforward to decipher. Those who know him well say he is highly intelligent and well-mannered, a man of many strengths with a good memory and a good sense of humor. Although he has shown himself to be a strong defender of priestly celibacy, his views on controversies such as Fiducia Supplicans, Traditionis Custodes and other pastoral changes are mostly unknown. He is known to have some progressive tendencies or, as one source put it, “puts pressure on tradition.” Heung-sik has praised Pope Francis, is said to be close to the Pope, and has stressed his loyalty to the Pope’s positions. He was also supportive of the pontificate of John Paul II, and later Benedict, during their respective papacies. The cardinal has taken a noticeably softer line, particularly on the Church’s moral teaching, over the years, consistent with this pontificate. The Korean cardinal’s most controversial position is arguably his enthusiastic support for secretive Vatican-Beijing accords on the appointment of bishops.

247,Zen Ze-Kiun,"Cardinal Joseph Zen Ze-kiun, the Bishop Emeritus of Hong Kong, has been a prominent advocate for human rights and religious freedom in China and a leading opponent of the Vatican’s 2018 secret agreement with Beijing on the appointment of bishops in China. Born on January 13, 1932, in Shanghai, Zen fled to Hong Kong in 1948 to escape Communist rule following the Chinese Civil War and that same year joined the Salesians there. He was ordained priest on February 11, 1961, and pursued higher education, obtaining a licentiate in theology in 1961 and a doctorate in philosophy in 1964 from the Salesian Pontifical University in Rome. After his ordination, Zen taught in various seminaries in China and Hong Kong and served as the Salesian Provincial Superior for China from 1978 to 1983. In 1996, Pope John Paul II appointed him as the coadjutor Bishop of Hong Kong. He became the Bishop of Hong Kong in 2002 and was elevated to cardinal by Pope Benedict XVI in 2006. Cardinal Zen has been a prominent voice for democracy and religious freedom in Hong Kong and mainland China. He has actively participated in pro-democracy demonstrations, including the 2003 protest against proposed anti-subversion laws and the 2014 Occupy Central movement. In 2011, he went on a three-day hunger strike to protest changes in how aided schools were run in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong cardinal has been outspoken on issues regarding human rights, political freedom, and religious liberty. He has consistently advocated for the rights of the underground Catholic Church in mainland China and has been critical of the Chinese government’s control over religious affairs. In recent years, Cardinal Zen has been a strident critic of the Vatican’s 2018 deal with China regarding the appointment of bishops, arguing that it would “kill” the underground church in China and compromise the Church’s independence. In May 2022, at the age of 90, Cardinal Zen was arrested in Hong Kong on charges related to the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund, which provided support to pro-democracy protesters. He was accused of failing to register the charity and of colluding with foreign forces. This arrest was widely seen as part of the Chinese government’s crackdown on dissent in Hong Kong and raised concerns about religious freedom in the region. Cardinal Zen’s arrest and the ongoing tensions between the Vatican and China have put him at the center of a complex geopolitical and religious situation. His advocacy for democracy and religious freedom, coupled with his criticism of both the Chinese government and the Vatican’s approach to China, has made him a controversial but respected figure in the Church and beyond.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Zen Ze-Kiun champions human rights and religious freedom, emphasizing the independence of the Catholic Church in China against governmental control.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is known for his resolute and outspoken nature, often engaging in direct confrontation with authority to advocate for democracy and religious liberty.

250,Gabriel Zubeir Wako,"South Sudan’s first cardinal, Gabriel Zubeir Wako is a retired Archbishop of Khartoum  known for his unwavering commitment to peace, refugees and human rights. Born on February 27, 1941, in Mboro, Sudan, Wako’s early years were marked by his passion for Christianity, which was nurtured by living close to the church during his childhood. Ordained on July 21, 1963, at the age of 22, Cardinal Wako’s priestly journey began as an assistant parish priest and inspector for Christian Religious Education in the Gogrial District schools. He later became the rector of St Anthony’s Minor Seminary in Bussere and served as the procurator for the Vicariate of Wau, where he also held the position of vicar delegate. Additionally, he was the provincial commissioner of the Boy Scouts and Girl Guides. On December 12, 1974, he was appointed Bishop of Wau and ordained on April 6, 1975. He then became the Coadjutor Bishop of Khartoum in October 1979. From 1981 to 2016 he served as the Archbishop of Khartoum.

251,Matteo Maria Zuppi,"Cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi has been a rapidly rising star in the Italian episcopate, an Italian prelate very much on the leftist political wing of the Church who would likely continue Pope Francis’ legacy, albeit with plenty of control from the Sant’Egidio lay community to which he has close ties. Born and raised in Rome, he has close family connections to the Vatican. His father, Enrico, was a journalist and a photographer whom the then–deputy secretary of state, Giovanni Battista Montini (the future Paul VI), appointed editor of L’Osservatore della Domenica, a weekly illustrated edition of L’Osservatore Romano. Matteo’s mother, Carla Fumagalli, was the niece of Cardinal Carlo Confalonieri, who served as secretary to Pope Pius XI, then as prefect of the Congregation for Bishops and as dean of the College of Cardinals at the funerals of Popes Paul VI and John Paul I.1 The fifth of six children, young Matteo went to secondary school in Rome’s historic center and there met Andrea Riccardi, founder of the Sant’Egidio movement.2 He soon became involved with the nascent community, which he regarded as “another Gospel and another Church.” In 1977, aged twenty-two, he completed a degree in literature and philosophy at La Sapienza University in Rome, with a thesis on the life of Cardinal Alfredo Ildefonso Schuster.3 He then entered a seminary in the suburban-Rome Diocese of Palestrina and studied for the priesthood at the Pontifical Lateran University, where he obtained a bachelor’s degree in theology. Ordained a priest for the Diocese of Palestrina in 1981, he was first assigned as an assistant parish priest of Santa Maria in Trastevere under Msgr. Vincenzo Paglia. While there, he held a number of additional positions, including rector of a nearby church and head of a diocesan priestly council. In 1992, Fr. Zuppi played a key role in the Sant’Egidio-brokered peace accords with Mozambique, leading him to be made an honorary citizen of the country. In 2000, when Vincenzo Paglia was made bishop of Terni, Zuppi replaced him as parish priest of Santa Maria in Trastevere and as ecclesiastical assistant to Sant’Egidio. In 2006, Benedict XVI granted him the honorary title of Chaplain to His Holiness.4 In 2010, he was transferred to serve in one of Rome’s largest parishes on the city’s periphery, and in 2012, Benedict XVI appointed him auxiliary bishop of Rome. Archbishop Paglia was one of his co-consecrators. Pope Francis appointed Zuppi archbishop of Bologna in 2015, succeeding Cardinal Carlo Caffarra, and elevated him to cardinal in 2019. Apart from his native Italian, Cardinal Zuppi has some knowledge of English but is not listed as being proficient in speaking any other languages. Matteo Zuppi is a personable prelate with friends across the political spectrum in his native Rome. As someone with a lifelong concern for the poor and marginalized, forged through his close connections with the Sant’Egidio community, the Italian prelate reveals himself to be a true son of the spirit of Vatican II, someone who seeks to engage constantly with the modern world and implement the “profound change” that he believes the Council wanted for the Church. That means helping the Church to “listen again to the many questions of the world,” beginning with a concept of mercy, which, he says, “represents the attitude of the post-conciliar Church.” His approach is about “rejecting hate,” engendering “authentic solidarity,” embracing religious pluralism and “fraternity,” and going out to the peripheries to help the poor and the marginalized — whether they be destitute drug addicts, impoverished gypsy children, or elderly persons who have been abandoned — earning him the moniker “street priest.” He also strives to include same-sex-attracted people and the divorced and civilly “remarried,” and engage Muslims, Jews, and the concerns of migrants. Appointed archbishop and created cardinal by Pope Francis, Matteo Zuppi shows himself to be fully committed to adhering to the vision of this pontificate and seeing it to fruition, beginning with Francis’ Apostolic Exhortation Evangelii Gaudium and including the pontificate’s seminal and controversial interreligious document on human fraternity, signed in Abu Dhabi in 2019. He has taken part in several Vatican synods; he sees synodality as fundamental for renewing the Church and helping ecclesial communities overcome entrenched isolation. For Zuppi, individualism is anathema and community, activism, and mission must come first. He has a devotion to Our Lady and values prayer, on which he places considerable importance, but his emphasis on social justice and equality has inevitably brought him into alliances with Italian leftist politics. So much so, that when Francis announced that he was elevating Zuppi to the College of Cardinals, the Italian media joked that the “chaplain” of Italy’s leading socialist party was to become a cardinal. Zuppi has also had connections with a movement opposed to Matteo Salvini, the populist leader of Italy’s Lega Party; eulogized two far-left, pro-abortion Italian radicals at their funerals; and even incardinated into the Bologna Archdiocese a communist priest who ran for a seat in the European Parliament. Cardinal Zuppi is closely connected with a prominent Italian Freemason. Gioele Magaldi, a Rome native who founded the distinctively progressive Grande Oriente Democratico masonic obedience in 2010, said in an October 2020 interview that he knew “the Vatican world well” and that, “among the cardinals, the one I esteem the most is Matteo Zuppi, who, among other things, married me.” Magaldi added: “He would make an excellent Pope.” He has been especially fervent in welcoming homosexuals and homosexual “love,” usually without any injunctions to amendment of life. But despite his distinctly “progressive” leanings and connections with Freemasonry, he also tries to dialogue with those on the right and keep channels open with those who favor Church tradition. He has celebrated the old Mass on at least two occasions and in 2022 celebrated solemn Vespers in the Pantheon. Contrasting with his humble “street priest” persona is the fact that he heads one of the world’s wealthiest dioceses, thanks to an astonishingly generous endowment of $1.8 billion to the Archdiocese of Bologna made just a few years prior to his appointment. It is not always easy to know exactly where Zuppi, an intelligent prelate with a sharp mind, stands on doctrine and other issues, as he has shown himself able to tailor his message to his audience or his pope. Invariably his views will lean clearly in a heterodox direction, such as on the indissolubility of marriage, homosexuality, gender ideology, and hell. His supporters would say this makes him able to tackle the complexities of the modern world; his critics might describe him as a clever, archetypal modernist.","• Theology/Ideology: Cardinal Zuppi embodies a leftist political wing of the Church, advocating for social justice, mercy, and inclusivity, particularly for marginalized groups.  
• Personality/Negotiation: He is a personable and diplomatic prelate with a reputation for building bridges across the political spectrum and fostering dialogue with diverse communities.  
• Power Base: Zuppi is closely aligned with the Sant’Egidio community and has connections to influential figures in both the Church and Italian leftist politics, giving him a substantial support network.  
• Core Motivation: His primary motivation is to enact the vision of Vatican II by promoting community, activism, and a Church that actively engages with contemporary societal issues.","Cardinal Matteo Maria Zuppi is a prominent figure within the Church, known for his commitment to social justice, mercy, and inclusivity, particularly for marginalized communities.
